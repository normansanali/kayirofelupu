For his role in&nbsp;<span>Angels in America</span><span>, the actor won an Emmy and a Golden Globe award.&nbsp;He originally played the role in a Broadway production of the miniseries, winning a Tony Award in the process.&nbsp;Wright is one of those private stars whose movie characters are better recognized than his true self.&nbsp;Here is his story.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jeffrey Wright Bio (Ethnicity)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jeffrey Wright was born on December 7, 1965 in Washington, D.C. He’s obviously African American, although he doesn’t really feel like Hollywood.&nbsp;Additionally, he is of Hispanic descent.&nbsp;Wright’s mother was a lawyer who worked as a customs lawyer.&nbsp;Unfortunately for Wright, he lost his father when he was just a child and that’s why his mother was given the responsibility of raising him alone.</span></p><p><span>Jeffrey Wright attended an independent college preparatory school for boys, St. Albans School, and later a private liberal arts college, Amherst College.&nbsp;He is a graduate in political science.&nbsp;After college, Wright considered following in his mother’s footsteps to become a lawyer, but he soon changed his mind to focus on acting.&nbsp;He enrolled in New York University, but two months later dropped out to actively pursue a career in acting.</span></p><p>Starting out in Washington DC and New York, Wright began acting in off-Broadway productions and quickly transitioned into film and television.&nbsp;For his first film role, he played the role of a lawyer in the 1990s.&nbsp;<span>Presumed innocent</span><span>&nbsp;and it’s safe to say that his mother’s legal side really erased him.&nbsp;The film starred Harrison Ford.&nbsp;Wright’s small-screen debut came a year later in the television movie,&nbsp;</span><span>Separate But Equal</span></p><p><span>Wright would continue to appear in films and television shows simultaneously.&nbsp;However, her first critical success came from a theatrical role.&nbsp;He played a gay nurse in the Broadway production of&nbsp;</span><span>Angels in America,</span><span>&nbsp;winning his first-ever award, a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.</span></p><p><span>The actor received critical praise for his role in the 1996 film,&nbsp;</span><span>Basquiat</span><span>.&nbsp;He won big with roles in&nbsp;</span><span>Ride with the Devil</span><span>&nbsp;(1999),&nbsp;</span><span>Tree</span><span>&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;</span><span>Boycott</span><span>&nbsp;(2001),&nbsp;</span><span>Angels in America</span><span>&nbsp;(2003), and&nbsp;</span><span>Broken Flowers</span><span>&nbsp;(2005).&nbsp;Jeffrey Wright starred opposite Daniel Craig in three films, including two James Bond films;&nbsp;</span><span>Casino Royale</span><span>&nbsp;(2006) and&nbsp;</span><span>Quantum of Solace</span><span>&nbsp;(2008), as well as&nbsp;</span><span>The Invasion</span><span>&nbsp;(2007).</span></p><p>Jeffrey Wright continues to build his filmography both on the big screen and on television.</p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>He may not be one of the most popular faces Jeffrey Wright has played in some highly acclaimed gigs that have him much in the bank, for example, his role in&nbsp;</span><span>The Hunger Games</span><span>&nbsp;film series which began with 2013&nbsp;</span><span>Catching Fire</span><span>.&nbsp;Thus, his net worth is estimated at $7 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>women</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jeffrey Wright was married to actor CarmenElizabeth Ejogo for fourteen years.&nbsp;They married in 2000 and divorced in 2014. Their union produced two children, a son Elijah and a daughter Juno.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Wright, Ejogo was previously married to English record producer and musician Adrian Nicholas Mathews, better known as Tricky.&nbsp;Their marriage lasted barely a year in 1998.</span></p><p><span>Wright’s ex-wife is British.&nbsp;She was born on October 22, 1973 in Kensington, London to a Nigerian father, Charles Ejogo (now deceased) and a Scottish mother, Elizabeth Douglas.&nbsp;Carmen has a younger brother, Charles Ejogo, who, like their father, is an entrepreneur.&nbsp;Charles is famous for inventing the Umbrolly umbrella vending machine.&nbsp;The innovation won him £150,000 funding from the BBC show, Dragons’ Den.</span></p><p><span>Carmen Ejogo has appeared in many television series including;&nbsp;Abducted, CHAOS, zero hour.&nbsp;Some of her films include&nbsp;</span><span>Selma</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Born to be Blue</span><span>.&nbsp;Wright and Carmen starred together in&nbsp;</span><span>Boycott</span><span>.&nbsp;Carmen is also a musician and has collaborated with many artists since the 90s.</span></p><h2><strong><span>other facts</span></strong></h2><p><span>1. Jeffrey Wright is 5 feet 11 inches tall.</span></p><p><span>2. One of her trademarks is her deep, sweet voice.</span></p><p><span>3. His Alma University, Amherst College, awarded him an honorary degree in 2004.</span></p><p><span>4. Wright was the first African-American to play the role of Felix Leiter in a James Bond film.</span></p><p><span>5.
