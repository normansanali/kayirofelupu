Following the debate, many users have questioned Mike of the Boston Celtics regarding Udoka’s suspension.</p><p>Let’s not jump to conclusions too quickly, considering there haven’t been any reliable revelations concerning Zarren’s wife and her relationship with the head coach. Even the existence of the assistant general manager’s wife is uncertain.</p><figure></figure><p>Despite serving Boston Celtics for several years, Zarren has been the franchise’s least famous but most influential name.</p><p>Well, the assistant Gm, who is in his&nbsp;40s, might be married with kids, but no valid details about his private affair have been cited on his social media handles.</p><p>Precisely, Zarren prefers to keep his family details under wrap; the only family-related information that has come to light is when his family visited South Africa.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=celtics-vp-mike-attended-games-with-father-since-his-childhood></span>Celtics VP Mike Attended Games With Father Since His Childhood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a child, Mike Zarren and his father witnessed the storied Celtics teams of Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, and Larry Bird on season tickets at the old Boston Garden.</p><p>Zarren, an AB ’99,&nbsp;continued&nbsp;to watch home games on the balcony with his father almost three decades later.</p><p>Throughout two seasons, he penned seven Inside the Numbers essays, the latter of which was published on April 23, 2007.</p><figure></figure><p>The Celtics won the NBA title the following season, drawing imitative attention to every facet of the team, even the suddenly reserved statistician sitting in the stands with his father.</p><p>Likewise, the deputy general manager for the Boston Celtics schedules time each offseason to go&nbsp;sailing&nbsp;in Marblehead Harbor with his father.</p><p>Midway through October of 2017, the Celtics’ season was starting, the water was getting more relaxed, and boats were being stored. When Zarren finds that he and his father only took a single sailing trip, he chuckles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zarren-joined-the-boston-celtics-as-a-full-timer-in-2005></span>Zarren Joined The Boston Celtics As A Full-Timer In 2005<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Celtics GM Mike never played basketball after high school, and his primary extracurricular pursuit in Chicago was the quiz bowl.</p><p>He majored in&nbsp;economics and was mentored&nbsp;by professor and co-author of Freakonomics Steven Levitt, who inspired him to embrace statistics. But much to Levitt’s dismay, Zarren decided to use his abilities at Harvard Law.</p><p>The club was trying to expand during Zarren’s second year of law school and was looking for an unpaid statistician. The Celtics intended to investigate the possibility of data-intensive NBA player analysis, which went beyond the standard points, rebounds, and assists.</p><figure></figure><p>In 2005, Zarren began working for the franchise full-time.</p><p>Zarren was a front-office fascination due to the novelty of his work and the suspicion of traditionalists; according to Zarren’s boss, Danny Ainge, Celtics coach Doc Rivers was “skeptically receptive” to Zarren’s analyses.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-boston-celtics-rented-him-satellite-phone></span>The Boston Celtics Rented Him Satellite Phone<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Mike Zarren spends most of his waking hours just a phone call away from league-altering deals, yet nine years ago, a two-week safari to southern Africa with his family would have put him in the dark for days. The Boston Celtics devised a solution by renting him a satellite phone.</p><p>According to&nbsp;The Athletic, Zarren just made one call on the phone to the crew to make sure it was functional before the journey.</p><p>Luckily, it never rang again, saving his trip. The crew had anticipated a peaceful summer, and it had been one in August 2013. That’s not always the case, though, as the most recent offseason showed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-was-philadelphia-76ers-top-choice-for-gm-in-2013></span>He Was Philadelphia 76ers Top Choice For GM In 2013<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;The Ringer’s Kevin O’Connor, who cited NBA sources, the Boston Celtics associate general manager was a top candidate to succeed Bryan Colangelo as general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers.</p><p>In 2013, Zarren attended the job interview; however, Sam Hinke was chosen by the Sixers. After more than five years and a significant Twitter issue, the Sixers may revive their earlier interest in Zarren, in an&nbsp;article posted&nbsp;in 2018.</p><figure></figure><p>After a team investigation discovered that Colangelo’s wife had been using burner Twitter accounts to protect her husband and disparage Sixers players, Colangelo resigned as the organization’s president of basketball operations.</p><p>Before the team replaced Colangelo, head coach Brett Brown reportedly oversaw basketball operations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-zarrens-net-worth-amid-his-decade-long-career-in-the-franchise></span>Mike Zarren’s Net Worth Amid His Decade-Long Career In The Franchise<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Numerous rumors concerning the role with the Boston Celtics have been put in jeopardy due to the current incident surrounding Ime Udoka and his replacement until the suspension.</p><p>In essence, if Brad Steven, the GM, were to take over as head coach, Zarren—who is more than ready for the position—would presumably be given GM duties (via&nbsp;92.9 FM).</p><p>That will undoubtedly boost his wealth and net worth ratio, which is presently unclear. However, after a lengthy career with the franchise, Zarren’s estimated net worth is in a million range.</p><p>Before becoming a management consultant, Mike worked as a law clerk on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and conducted econometric and other quantitative assessments for Fortune 500 companies in several industries.</p><p>Additionally, Mike is a member of the&nbsp;Advisory Board of Rank The Vote, the Board of Trustees of The Waring School, and Voter Choice MA.</p><p>These non-partisan organizations were working to improve our country’s electoral processes by ensuring that election results fairly reflect the preferences of the majority of voters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mike-zarren-salary-and-career-earnings></span>Mike Zarren Salary And Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Working for the Celtics for many years, Zarren may have amassed a massive salary from his role as the vice president of basketball operations.</p><p>Several internet sources have projected his remuneration to be over a million even if the precise amount of his salary is unknown.</p><p>In 2006, Boston completed a multiplayer deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Zarren illustrated that the Celtics improved from 19th to 11th in points per possession after the trade—becoming a stronger scoring team despite the per-game decline—even though their offensive output decreased marginally.</p><p>When Zarren’s name appeared as a potential contender for the Philadelphia 76ers general manager position, Sports Illustrated referred to him as “one of the least-known yet most&nbsp;prominent members&nbsp;of the Celtics’ front office.”</p><p>Ultimately, he decided against running and stayed in Boston, where his career has given the phrase “fantasy basketball” a new meaning.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-mike-zarren-originally-from></span>Where Is Mike Zarren Originally From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zarren is a Massachusetts native, hailing from Swampscott, and is well-known as a Celtics season ticket holder and lifelong fan of his hometown team.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-did-mike-zarren-graduate-from></span>Where Did Mike Zarren Graduate From?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Assistant GM Mike Zarren graduated from Harvard Law School and the University of Chicago.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-mike-zarren-joined-the-boston-celtics></span>When Did Mike Zarren Joined The Boston Celtics?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zarren joined the franchise in 2005.
