Maurice was wrongfully convicted and had to spend all his young age in prison. Recently, the DA's office released the statement and vacated the conviction over Maurice Hastings. Moreover, they apologized for the trouble it brought to the life of Maurice Hastings.</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:18pt><strong>Who Is Maurice Hastings? Wikipedia Details</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Maurice Hastings is the man who was wrongly convicted of the Inglewood Murder and spent 38 years of his life in prison. Recently, his innocence was proved after an examination of DNA evidence. He was charged with the murder of Roberta Wydermyer and two attempted murders. Maurice Hastings' Wikipedia page is not yet available.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Maurice Hastings grew up with his parents and siblings in California. However, the names of his father and his mother are still a mystery. His mother passed away in June 2022 before she could see him out of prison.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Maurice Hastings was born in 1953, making him 69 years old as of 2022.

In 1983, she went on midnight shopping when she went missing. Authorities claimed that her killer stole her belongings, assaulted her, and eventually shot her in the head. Her body was then placed in the trunk of the car, which the killer took.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Later, while the car was spotted, her husband and friend pursued the car. Eventually, the suspect fired shots which led to her husband's wound.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Maurice was arrested months after the incident. Firstly, the trial ended with a hung jury, but he was convicted in his second trial. Later, the court sentenced him to life in prison</span> without parole.</p><h2><strong><span style=font-size:18pt>Maurice Hastings Was Wrongfully Imprisoned</span></strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Even though Maurice Hastings maintained his innocence from the very first day, during the examination of the dead body, semen was detected in her mouth, and Hastings sought for DNA test in 2000. However, the DA's office denied his request.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>Finally, he got his DNA test in June 2022, and the findings showed that the semen in her mouth wasn't his. The DNA matched another man who was sentenced to 56 years and died in 2020.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>After spending 38 years in prison, Maurice was set free.</span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:18pt><strong>Where Is Maurice Hastings Now?</strong></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-size:12pt>After spending almost four decades in prison, Maurice Hastings was released in October 2022.
