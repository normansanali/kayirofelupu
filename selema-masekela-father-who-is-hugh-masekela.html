Who was Selema’s father? Is he still alive? What did he do for a living?</p><p>Keep scrolling down this article to learn about Selema.</p><h3><strong>Meet Hugh Masekela, Selema Masekela Father</strong></h3><p>Selema Masekela was born to his renowned African Jazz musician father Hugh Masekela. Hugh passed away on 18 January 2018.</p><p>Selema talked about his relationship with his father on <a href=#>UPROXX</a> in February 2022. Speaking with to the host he said, “But I feel him with me more and more every day.”</p><p>He continued, “The first year I felt like I was just alone and then I started to feel the down lows and you feel him and it’s like a wave of grief and then a wave a realization of like you can feel him textually and he is giving you these little moves and hints.”</p><p>Furthermore, Selema shared that the earliest memories of his time with his father were in the club. They would hang out during the day and go hang out with for burgers and hang out with his friends. Every time Selema went to see his father play, he was excited to see him like it was his first time doing that.</p><p>What Selema loved about his father was wherever Hugh went he got to go on the road. He ended up being a roadie with him on the Graceland tour with Paul Simon.</p><p>In August 2023, Hugh was inducted into The Lincoln Center Jazz Hall of Fame.</p><p>Hugh raised Selema in Staten Island, New York, and Carlsbad, California. He himself started playing music around 2nd grade.</p><p>In 1992, Selema began working for Transworld Publications as an intern. During the 2003–2004 NBA season, he also worked as a sideline reporter for ESPN. From September 26, 2010, until its cancellation, he co-hosted E!’s The Daily 10, a countdown of the day’s “top 10” entertainment stories. For 13 years, he also hosted the X Games and Winter X Games on ESPN. He hosted and served as executive producer of VICELAND’s docuseries VICE World of Sports after his time with ESPN.</p><p>Alekesam, the name of Selema’s own band, was also the title of his debut movie, which was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2012 and chronicled his relationship with his father and how they connected via music.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Selema has had music included on Entourage and House of Lies, with their most recent track, “All Is Forgiven,” being featured on the Showtime hit’s season four premiere.</p><h3><strong>Hugh Masekela Age At The Time Of His Death</strong></h3><p>At the time of his passing, Hugh Masekela was 78 years old. He was born on 4 April 1939.</p><h3><strong>Hugh Masekela Job</strong></h3><p>Hugh Masekela was a musician and political activist. He began playing the piano as a young child and displayed musical talent at a young age. Hugh started playing the trumpet after being inspired by the film Young Man with a Horn, supported by anti-apartheid campaigner Father Trevor Huddleston, who assisted him in buying the instrument.</p><p>Hugh then took trumpet instruction from Uncle Sauda, a member of the Johannesburg ‘Native’ Municipal Brass Band, at Huddleston’s request. Soon after learning how to play the trumpet, He joined the Huddleston Jazz Band, South Africa’s first youth orchestra, where he played alongside other aspiring artists.</p><p>Hugh shared the stage alongside performers like Dollar Brand (Abdullah Ibrahim), Jonas Gwangwa, and Kippie Moeketsi while he was just a youngster in South Africa. Along with these individuals, Masekela also worked with Miriam Makeba, Dorothy Masuka of Zimbabwe, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Hedzoleh Soundz, Francis Fuster, and Dudu Pukwana.</p><p>Additionally, Hugh was a crucial component of the orchestra for Todd Matshikiza’s South African version of the Broadway musical King Kong. This happened when Masekela went on tour in 1958 with the jazz group the Manhattan Brothers and spent two years performing on the West End of London. Many of the musicians mentioned above participated in this popular musical.</p><p>Hugh’s personal experiences had a profound impact on him, and as a result, he created music that captured his impressions of the challenging political environment in South Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. The difficulties and delights of living in South Africa are thus portrayed in Masekela’s song, which also expresses protest against slavery and injustice.</p><p>As Selema remembers wherever Hugh went while touring he would try to see where “the people” were and tried to speak for them. This allowed him to gather material for him as a champion of people and struggle.</p><p>Hugh went on to compose and record many new songs in New York; including his 1968 number-one hit ‘Grazing in the Grass’. He played primarily in jazz ensembles, like the Jazz Epistles, and successfully collaborated with international artists like The Byrds and Paul Simon.</p><p dir=ltr>Hugh Masekela had also produced music for musicals like Sarafina, and was featured in the 2003 documentary film Amandla! Masekela’s musical style continues to incorporate various African styles fused with jazz and funk and has evolved into more of an adult contemporary style, which can be heard on his albums Techno-Bush, Tomorrow, Uptownship, and Revival.</p><p dir=ltr>Hugh Masekela continued to produce music and tour extensively throughout the world, which recently included a 2007 tour to the USA and Canada to promote the live recording, “Hugh Masekela: Live at the Market Theatre”. A Grammy Award winner for “Best Contemporary Pop Performance-Instrumental” as far back as 1968, Masekela is still honored today as one of South Africa’s most prominent and talented musicians.</p><p>He was in political exile for 30 years.</p><h3><strong>Was Hugh Masekela On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, Hug Masekela was not on Instagram.</p><h3><strong>Hugh Masekela Height</strong></h3><p>Hugh Masekela stood tall above the height of 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Was Hugh Masekela From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Hugh Masekela hailed from Witbank, Mmpumalanga (then Eastern Transvaal), South Africa.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Was Hugh Masekela Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Hugh Masekela’s birthday is on 4 April.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrJ2cmrqiecyaqp6jlaGubrLArZ%2Beql2stbB5yKxkoa2XnXqurdKeop6kkWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-seth-macfarlanes-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Seth MacFarlanes wife?">&larr;
