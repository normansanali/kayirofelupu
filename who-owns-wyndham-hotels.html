It describes itself as the largest hotel franchisor in the world, with 9,280 locations. The company was formed on June 1, 2018, as a spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide. The company’s origins can be traced back to the founding of Hospitality Franchise Systems (HFS) in 1990, which later merged with CUC International to form Cendant Corporation. In 2005, Cendant bought the Wyndham hotel brand from the Blackstone Group. In 2006, as part of a plan to break Cendant up into four separate companies, its hotel and timeshare businesses were spun off as Wyndham Worldwide. In 2018, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts completed its spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide.</p><h3>Key Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Wyndham Hotels & Resorts is the largest hotel franchisor in the world, with 9,280 locations.</li><li>The company was formed as a spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide in 2018.</li><li>Wyndham Hotels has a rich history that dates back to the founding of Hospitality Franchise Systems in 1990.</li><li>Cendant Corporation acquired the Wyndham hotel brand in 2005.</li><li>Wyndham Hotels & Resorts completed its spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide in 2018.</li></ul><h2>Wyndham Hotels & Resorts History</h2><p>The history of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts can be traced back to the founding of Hospitality Franchise Systems (HFS) in 1990. HFS was established as a platform to acquire hotel franchises and quickly expanded its portfolio by acquiring well-known brands such as Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Ramada, and Super 8.</p><p>In 1997, HFS merged with CUC International, leading to the formation of Cendant Corporation, which further bolstered the company’s diverse range of businesses. The acquisition spree continued, and in 2005, Cendant acquired the renowned Wyndham hotel brand from the Blackstone Group, adding another prestigious name to its collection.</p><p>Following a corporate restructuring in 2006, Cendant spun off its hotel and timeshare businesses to create Wyndham Worldwide. This move allowed Wyndham Hotels & Resorts to operate as an independent entity with a dedicated focus on its hotel operations and franchise model.</p><p>In 2018, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts completed its final spin-off as a separate publicly traded company, solidifying its position as a leading player in the hospitality industry.</p><h2>Wyndham Hotel Group and Acquisitions</h2><p>Under the umbrella of Wyndham Worldwide, <b>Wyndham Hotel Group</b> was composed of over 9,000 hotels under 21 brands, ranging from economy to upscale. The company has experienced significant growth through strategic acquisitions, further strengthening its position in the global hospitality industry.</p><p><b>Wyndham Hotel Group</b> has made several notable acquisitions, expanding its brand portfolio and market presence. Some of these acquisitions include:</p><li>U.S. Franchise Systems: In 2000, <b>Wyndham Hotel Group</b> acquired U.S. Franchise Systems, the owner of the Microtel and Hawthorn Suites brands. This acquisition allowed Wyndham to diversify its offerings and tap into the economy and extended stay segments of the market.</li><li>TRYP hotel brand: In 2010, Wyndham Hotel Group acquired the TRYP hotel brand from Sol Meliá Hotels & Resorts. The TRYP brand positioned itself as a lifestyle hotel brand, catering to modern travelers seeking unique and experiential accommodations.</li><li>Fën Hotels: Wyndham Hotel Group expanded its presence in Latin America through the acquisition of Fën Hotels. This acquisition added 26 management contracts in Latin America, contributing to Wyndham’s international growth strategy.</li><li>AmericInn: In 2017, Wyndham Hotel Group acquired the AmericInn hotel brand, reinforcing its position in the midscale segment of the market. The acquisition added over 200 properties to Wyndham’s portfolio.</li><li>La Quinta: One of the significant acquisitions made by Wyndham Hotel Group was the purchase of the La Quinta hotel brand in 2018. This acquisition further expanded Wyndham’s midscale business, bringing in over 900 La Quinta properties.</li><p>These strategic acquisitions have allowed Wyndham Hotel Group to diversify its brand offerings, enter new markets, and cater to a broader range of travelers. The company’s brand portfolio now encompasses a wide range of hotel options, from economy to upscale, providing guests with a variety of choices to suit their preferences and budget.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wyndham-Hotel-Group-and-Acquisitions-1024x585.jpg alt="Wyndham Hotel Group and Acquisitions" title="Wyndham Hotel Group and Acquisitions" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><tr><th>Brand</th><th>Segment</th><th>Number of Hotels</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Wyndham Grand</td><td>Upscale</td><td>150+</td></tr><tr><td>Dolce Hotels and Resorts</td><td>Distinctive</td><td>20+</td></tr><tr><td>TRYP</td><td>Lifestyle</td><td>100+</td></tr><tr><td>La Quinta Inns & Suites</td><td>Midscale</td><td>900+</td></tr><tr><td>Super 8</td><td>Economy</td><td>2,000+</td></tr><tr><td>Howard Johnson</td><td>Economy</td><td>400+</td></tr></tbody><h2>Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Spin-Off</h2><p>Following the spin-off from Wyndham Worldwide, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts became an independent company in 2018.
