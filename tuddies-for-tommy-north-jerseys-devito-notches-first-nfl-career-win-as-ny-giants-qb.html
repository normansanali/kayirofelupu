"The decision was made since this level of football is stressful for a rookie, especially from the quarterback position. There is a lot going on, a lot of meetings. So everything outside of football is handled by my family."&nbsp;</p><p>DeVeto once again captured the nation's eyes on Sunday when he celebrated a Saquon Barkley touchdown with a little Italian flare.</p><p>After going undrafted, the New Jersey native is earning approximately $44,000 per week after signing a contract worth upwards of $2.7 million, though it is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, Jones signed a four-year $160 million contract with $92 million guaranteed, according to <strong><a href=#>Sportrac</a></strong>.</p><p>DeVito is the son of a hard-working plumber, Tom, who has made headlines all his own after being spotted in the stands <strong><a href=#>questioning calls</a>, </strong>and mom Alexandra, who continues to take care of her son - and touting his success - even as he's become a household name.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, DeVito looks to be in the driver's seat running the Giants' offense after Taylor was placed on the Injured Reserve list.</p><p>In his <strong><a href=#>ESPN interview</a></strong>, DeVito was both joked about by teammates and praised for his intrinsic knowledge of Northern Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've been over there. I love going to his spot," fellow rookie Wide Receiver Jalin Hyatt mused about his parents' place. "He has a little hot tub in the back. The crazy thing about it is he lives, maybe, 15 minutes away. So he's close."</p><p>Offensive lineman Ben Bredeson also boasted about DeVito's Jersey swagger.</p><p>"When I came out here, that is what I thought a New Jersey guy was," <strong><a href=#>he said</a></strong>. "I love Tommy. Absolutely love Tommy. He's got, obviously, a loud personality. But he's always fun, always having a good time. He's just a very self-confident guy, and not in a bad way."&nbsp;</p><p>With his "Rudy" story now complete, the only question left is who plays the New Jersey native in the feel-good movie.&nbsp;</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Bergenfield and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBko52iqLK6e8GeqaCdnpu2prjDaKuunJSesrR5xaipZqyforq6ec2oqa2gXZ%2Bys7%2FEsqpmnJWrtrW7jKemrZuYmsBussirqq1lnpu5bq%2FAq5yeql2stq95wKxkp7FdnLaiutOsZKqaXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-dwyane-wade-is-one-of-the-most-underrated-nba-players-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Dwyane Wade is One of the Most Underrated NBA Players of All-Time">&larr;
