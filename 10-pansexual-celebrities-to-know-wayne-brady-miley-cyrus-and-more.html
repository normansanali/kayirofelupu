The fact that we are moving towards an age where people feel safer to do so, despite the harshness that can still follow coming out, shows we are heading a step in the right direction.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>Recently television host and comedian <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Brady came out as pansexual</a>, defined as being sexually or&nbsp;romantically&nbsp;attracted to people regardless of sex or gender. There is often some confusion over this term, even from within the LGBTQ+ community itself. The term bisexual means to be attracted to both genders, but some felt that this label didn’t correctly address exactly how they felt regarding their attraction.</p><p data-characters=527 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>Bisexual is an interesting one because it implies that there at two (“bi” meaning two) genders and that it wasn’t inclusive of transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. Now, arguments have been banded around, with many bisexual-identifying individuals claiming that this isn’t the case and that bisexual is not limited to just cis-gendered attraction. Different people have different definitions of what gender is and can be, but from this confusion, the term pansexual came into the foreground.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>This definition comes with the broader definition of being attracted to anyone regardless of gender, be it cisgender, gender fluid, or transgender. Now, with that cleared up as best as it can be with such a complicated topic that people have their own personal feelings on (myself included as a bisexual individual who is now wondering if that is accurate), let’s have a look at some of the celebrities we know who have come out as pansexual.</p><h3 id=h-wayne-brady data-injectable=false>Wayne Brady</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Wayne-Brady.jpg><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>Wayne Brady, famous for his comedic work on Whose Line Is It Anway? and hosting Let’s Make a Deal, is the most recent celeb to come out as pansexual. Talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, he said that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after contemplating bisexuality,</a> he “came to pansexual because — and I know that I’m completely messing up the dictionary meaning — but to me, pan means being able to be attracted to anyone who identifies as gay, straight, bi, transsexual or non-binary.”</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>He further expanded on how he sees pansexuality by stating, “I took pan to mean that not only can I be attracted to any of these people or types physically, but I could be attracted to the person there.” The actor realized this after focusing on his mental health after suffering from depression.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Miley Cyrus</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/miley-cyrus-2.png><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>The pop star came out as pansexual in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a> interview back in 2015, saying, “I’m very open about it – I’m pansexual. But I’m not in a relationship. I’m 22 and going on dates, but I change my style every two weeks, let alone who I’m with.” Cyrus knew from a young age that she was queer, having had a conversation with her mother, aged just 14, on the topic.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>She has been seen in a number of relationships, with her most well-known being her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, whom she married and later divorced. She is currently in a relationship with Maxx Morando.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Cara Delevigne</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cara-Delevingne.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>The model and actress has been open with her sexuality for some time now, though, as she states herself, it has been a fluid process. Having come out as bisexual in 2015, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she then added that she was gender fluid three years later</a>, and in 2020 came out as pansexual. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, “The thing is with me, I change a lot, I feel different all the time. Some days, I feel more womanly. Some days, I feel more like a man.”</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>It is likely this fluidity in her own identity allows her to see the attractive qualities in all, as she goes on to state, “I always will remain, I think, pansexual. However one defines themselves, whether it’s ‘they’ or ‘he’ or ‘she,’ I fall in love with the person — and that’s that. I’m attracted to the person.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Mae Whitman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mae-Whitman.jpg><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Actress Mae Whitman <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">came out on Twitter back in 2021</a>. The actress was celebrating the show The Owl House, in which she voiced Amity, Disney’s first major recurring lesbian character. While celebrating the show as another great animation celebrating queer people and culture, the actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>,</p><p>“Just taking a moment to say I am SO proud to be even a small part of a show like The Owl House. Being pansexual myself, I wish I had such incredible characters like Amity and Luz in my life when I was growing up. Queer representation is sososo important :,) keep it up world! #TOH.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Brendan Urie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Brendan-Urie.jpg><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>Panic! At The Disco frontman Brendon Urie came out as pansexual back in 2018. The musician was already an LGBTQ+ icon without having ever come out as a community member, with bangers such as “Girls/Girls/Boys” becoming anthems for LGBTQ+ groups. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Magazine</a>&nbsp;in 2018, he said, “I’m married to a woman, and I’m very much in love with her, but I’m not opposed to a man because I like a person. Yeah, I guess you could qualify me as pansexual because I really don’t care. If a person is great, then a person is great.”</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=124 data-injectable=false>When asked if that was his coming out he replied, “I guess so, I guess this is me coming out as&nbsp;pansexual.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Kesha</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kesha.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Kesha is an individual who has never really stated that they are pansexual, but the description of who they find attractive certainly would seem to imply they are (of course, everyone has their own way of labeling or choosing not to label themselves). The singer opened up about her sexuality in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seventeen Magazine</a> all the way back in 2013 and declared, “I don’t love&nbsp;just&nbsp;men. I love people. It’s not about gender. It’s just about the spirit that exudes from that other person you’re with.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Janelle Monáe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Janelle-Monae.jpg><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>Janelle Monáe is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">never one to conform to any norms</a>, and that includes her sexuality. The singer and actress constantly breaks ground from her music to her acting and her red carpet style. What she seeks is the freedom to express herself and live a life that is true to her, telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, “Being a queer black woman in America, someone who has been in relationships with both men and women – I consider myself to be a free-ass motherf****r.”</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>She originally identified as bisexual but has since changed her opinion on the topic, edifying, “Later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’ I’m open to learning more about who I am.”</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Yungblud</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Youngblud.jpg><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>British rapper Yungblud came out as pansexual back in 2020. It was in receiving his Gamechanger award from Attitude Awards that he came out about his own sexuality, not just as a pansexual but also polyamorous as well. When asked by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Magazine</a> if he considers himself a part of the community, he responded, “I know it’s such a massive statement to me, but probably, yeah, I think I would. I haven’t said that yet because I don’t want some mad article everywhere going, ‘Yungblud comes out as f*****g pan!’”</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>That is exactly what he stated, adding, “I wasn’t into that — like, my sexuality is mine, and I’m proud of it…I love everyone. I’m attracted to everyone.” He also credits his ex, the openly bisexual Halsey, for helping him make this discovery about himself.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Demi Lovato</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Demi-lovato.jpg><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>The singer and actor came out as gender fluid in 2021, asking everyone to use they/them pronouns. Since then, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have reincorporated she/her pronouns</a> due to getting tired of constantly educating people on the topic.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>The same year they also came out as pansexual while speaking to Joe Rogan on his podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>. They opened up about the “fluidity” of their attraction towards people, stating, “I’m so fluid now — and a part of the reason why I am so fluid is because I was super closeted off,” confirming they were pansexual.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Nico Tortorella</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nico-Tortorella.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Actor Nico Tortorella has appeared in shows like Younger and The Walking Dead: World Beyond, as well as films such as Scream 4, so he is very used to having people wanting to know more about them. In 2020 they fully opened up about their sexuality to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attitude Magazine</a>, about being gender fluid, pansexual, and polyamorous, as well as being in an open marriage. The star has been in a relationship with their now wife, Bethany C. Meyers, for 15 years but has explored their own sexuality outside of that too.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=false>These are not the only notable celebrities to have opened up about being pansexual, with the likes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JoJo Siwa</a>, Bella Thorne, Tess Holliday, Joe Lycett, and many others also confirming that they care less about gender and more about the person. Cliché as it may be, love is love, and when you do fall in love with someone, it’s usually their soul, not their body parts, at the end of the day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2R%2BcXnPmqWsnaiqrq15wp6jnpqinsGqsdJmq6hlm6O8uHnWmrCnnV2Xv6Kw2GakoqSVrnqkxdGuqmaZnpl6rrvRnmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christina-applegate.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Applegate- Bio, Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage">&larr;
