Source: Reddit</p><h4><span>More Details</span></h4><p>The police initially cross-examined him thinking that he was the culprit as he was still conscious even after being shot. However, later on, the authorities found the actual criminals behind this tragic incident.</p><p>The said criminals were Larry Lloyd Carver and his child Richie Lee Carver.</p><p>While uncovering the crime, the police found that one of the criminals, Richie, was an ex-flatmate with Ryan. The criminal fair went to the victim’s house to seek revenge for a presumed altercation.</p><p>Also, it was later found that Richie was the one who shot both of the victims. After shooting both Heather and her boyfriend, the criminals took a few weapons and a computer from the scene.</p><p>The decision for this tragic case was reported in June 2008 and the court charged Richie with felony murder, burglary, aggravated assault, and misconduct involving weapons.</p><p>This criminal was then ultimately condemned to life in jail. However, the other criminal, also Richie’s father – Larry’s charges were excused.</p><p>Despite these decisions, Larry was later blamed and charged in November 2011. While writing this biography, these two people are still believed to be serving their jail time in Arizona.</p><p>The father was sentenced by Judge Susanna Pineda on 25 January 2013.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-182649 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ryan-Waller-passed-away-due-to-complications-related-to-the-shooting-of-23-December-2006.jpg alt="Ryan Waller" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-182649 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ryan passed away due to complications related to the shooting of 23 December 2006.
