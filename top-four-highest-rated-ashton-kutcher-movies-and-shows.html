The actor would meet other future stars like Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon on the show, and together, the group grew and honed their acting skills.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/53/54/3c/53543cb51e74ababc538888af0d00b62.jpg><p><a href=#>By 2003 Kutcher had become more recognizable</a> for his acting talents and his work behind the scenes. The actor would serve as a producer and creator of different TV projects for studios. Besides that, Kutcher also continued starring in sitcoms and movies, including a role in “Two and a Half Men,” which earned him around $20 million yearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Kutcher has remained a big draw in Hollywood since his debut and has starred or worked on many top-rated movies, series, and TV shows. But first, this article will examine the four highest-rated <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a> movies and TV Shows.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=PunkD></span><strong>Punk’D</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In 2003 Kutcher hooked up with MTV to create an elaborate show that aimed to prank unsuspecting Hollywood stars and other celebrities. Kutcher served as the series’ co-creator and executive producer alongside Jason Goldberg. When the show premiered in 2003, actor Frankie Muniz became its first victim to get “Punk’D.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kucher hosted the show from 2003 till 2007, when the series supposedly ended. During this time, the show pranked Hollywood stars like Beyonce, Serena Williams, Katie Holmes, Nick Lachey, Halle Berry, Justin Timberlake, etc. Finally, in 2012 five years after the series ended, “Punk’D” returned to the screens.</p><p>However, this time instead of having Kutcher as host, the show returned with a different celebrity host every week, which included Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Dax Shepard, and Bam Margera. The rebranded series also taught viewers how the pranks’ set up. <a href=#>“Punk’D” has an audience score of 100%</a> on Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Vengeance></span><strong>Vengeance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>“Vengeance” is a 2022 movie that tells the story of a writer from New York, Ben (B.J. Novak), who receives a call stating that his “girlfriend,” Abilene Shaw (Lio Tipton), had died from a drug overdose. Although Ben had to scroll through his phone to figure out who this girl was, he still flew to Texas to attend Abby’s funeral.</p><p>When Abby’s brother (Boyd Holbrook) asks <a href=#>Ben to join him in a quest for VENGEANCE</a>, the writer realizes he could make their story into a podcast. However, the journey would take him through different twists and turns that changed his preconceived notions and perspectives. In the movie, Ashton Kutcher impressively portrayed a small-town music producer Quentin Sellers. “Vengeance” has received praise from critics for its impressive thoughtful comedy that questions stereotypes. The movie has a rating of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Butterfly_Effect></span><strong>The Butterfly Effect</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/1c/10/76/1c1076203ec92664b3fa2c9b6ea0bf1e.jpg><p>When the “<a href=#>Butterfly Effect” premiered in 2004</a>, the movie got panned by critics for being initially intriguing and a bit tasteless thriller. Still, the film became a massive hit among the audience, <a href=#>with an 81% audience score</a>. “Butterfly Effect,” tells the story of a college student Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher), who is afflicted with a painful headache that frequently makes him black out.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while unconscious, Evan can travel back in time to difficult moments in his childhood. He also altered the past for some of his friends, like Kayleigh (Amy Smart), who was molested by her father (Eric Stoltz). Nonetheless, Evan underestimated the impact of altering the past on the present. Consequently, Evan finds himself in nightmarish alternate realities, including one where he’s locked away in prison.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Guardian></span><strong>The Guardian</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/84/f5/3b/84f53b406309b81e5ffb1cb880252eb9.jpg><p><a href=#>“The Guardian” is a 2007 action film</a> that tells the story of Ben Randall (Kevin Costner), a veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer who turns to teach recruits after losing his crew in a fatal accident. However, while teaching, Ben meets a cocky swimming champion Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher). He then tries to mold him into his protégé and teach him to work well with others.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their relationship takes a more profound turn when Ben takes Jake on a mission in the deadly waters of the Bering Strait. “The Guardian” grossed $55 million at the domestic box office and has an audience score of 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwbC8jJ%2BmrqpdnbaotMSsq2aqkamypXnArJ%2Btp55iuLbAwqGcq2WdpMOqsdJmmKecXai1sMPSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joe-burrow-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Joe Burrow's Parents?
