In the past few years, he has gained a lot of media attention for his previous relationships, including being engaged to Ariana Grande just one month after being with her. Today, he's Kim Kardashian's new beau and a certain rapper is not very happy about that. The poor guy even made an Instagram and deleted it a week after due to Kanye West's toxic jealously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When that relationship drama isn't the main focus, Davidson has shown some simple and wholesome moments from time to time. <a href=#>His endearing friendship with John Mulaney</a> is a perfect example, as the latter shared a photo of Davidson holding his two-month-old son at the time with a positive expression. When that Instagram story featuring Uncle Pete went viral, fans have pointed out Davidson's chipped tooth and had a lot of questions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Scandalous Moments In Pete Davidson's Controversial Dating History Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-pete-davidson-39-s-teeth>What Happened To Pete Davidson's Teeth?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With social media taking one topic too seriously at times, there were many fans that either showed genuine concern or playfully joked about the chipped tooth. One fan even brought up the Donda artist in their tweet by "starting" a rumor that he chipped Davidson's tooth before he got a photo with Mulaney's son. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another fan tweeted</a> that they would be ticked off if they had their turn to date the SNL comedian and he chipped his tooth before the date could begin. In a deleted tweet, another Twitter user said, "As someone who spends a lot of time with a very strong baby, I'm just saying there's a nonzero chance the baby did that to Pete Davidson's tooth."</p><p>In general, it really shouldn't be a big deal whether someone has a chipped tooth or not. It can be distracting and concerning for someone who wants to look their best, but if it can be fixed, then it's nothing to really stress over. Though with the coverage going on revolving around him and Kim, plus West going to great lengths to threaten the two of them, fans do have a right to be concerned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kanye West Threatens Pete Davidson On New Donda 2 Song</a></span></p><h2 id=is-it-the-real-deal>Is It The Real Deal?</h2><p>For the chipped tooth, it has been confirmed that it is fake, putting fans at ease considering what he and his girlfriend Kim are having to go through. TMZ reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davidson's chipped tooth is just for a movie he is currently working on.</a> As for what movie that is, it isn't sure, but for his current filmography, he is still filming a movie titled The Home. With the movie being a horror thriller, it's plausible that something might have happened to Davidson's character to the point where he ended up getting a chipped tooth in a conflict or accident. Or it could be for a totally different project, only time will tell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who even knows how long Davidson will be sporting the chipped tooth look? It could be for some time until he no longer needs it for his film project. What's assuring is that thankfully, nothing has happened that resulted in a physical altercation, though it doesn't help that West threatened that he would absolutely kick his a**.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Pete Davidson Earns And Spends His $8 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=keeping-up-with-kim-kardashian>Keeping Up With Kim Kardashian</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far in his love life, Davidson's relationship with Kim has been going great. The SNL comedian has been getting along with her kids really well and Davidson's mother has described Kim as a very sweet person. The only real issue is having to deal with threats from West and his attempts to win her back, but strangely enough, Davidson is very understanding and chill regarding the latter situation. We can only hope that a restraining order can be filed so that things won't have to escalate if the two were to encounter in person.</p><p>Even though the chipped tooth is for a project, that hasn't stopped Kim from being head over heels for him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She has been celebrating her winning bid from divorcing West</a> and officially declaring her as a single woman. She has removed the last name West in all of her social media once the announcement was made legal. For three months of anxiously waiting for her martial status to change, Kim is a step closer to feeling free and if things work out for her and Davidson, they could potentially tie the knot, and it may be bye-bye Kim Kardashian West and hello Kim Kardashian Davidson. The lengths she went through to defend her boyfriend after West released an animated, but brutal music video for the song "Eazy" featuring rapper The Game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kanye West Asks Fans To Scream At Pete Davidson If They See Him</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nTnpytoF2brqyxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cate-campbell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cate Campbell - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career, Single, Facts">&larr;
