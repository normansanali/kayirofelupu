After the news of his passing, his fans started paying to him and his grieving family members. But, they also wondered did he leave behind a girlfriend or a wife?</p><p>We attempt to cover it all below in this article. So, keep on scrolling to learn more about him.</p><h3><strong>NASCAR Driver Bobby East Death Details</strong></h3><p>NASCAR driver Bobby East was fatally stabbed to death at a gas station in Orange County, California. Bobby was found with a stab wound to his chest when police arrived at a petrol station in Westminster, an Orange County city, shortly before 6 o’clock, according to the police department.</p><p>He was taken to a trauma center where he died of injuries. Trent William Milsap, a parolee from Orange County, was named as the suspect by Westminster police officers.</p><p>Trent “became confrontational” when the West County SWAT Team arrived at an Anaheim apartment complex on Friday to execute an arrest warrant. A police dog was then brought in, and Milsap was ultimately shot and killed by police, according to the agency.</p><p>Police stated on Saturday that they did not know the reason behind the attack that murdered East. Milsap was initially characterized by Westminster police as a vagrant who was known to stay at hotels in Westminster as well as adjacent Garden Grove and Anaheim. In a previous press release on the attack, the suspect’s age was given as 27 and his last name was misspelled as Millsap. He was being sought for an unrelated parole breach while on parole for armed robbery, according to the police.</p><p>Westminster police said in a statement that they have recognized Bobby as a former NASCAR driver. He is from San Dimas, a city in eastern Los Angeles County, according to the Westminster department.</p><p>Early Saturday evening NASCAR released a statement acknowledging the death of one of its own.</p><p>“NASCAR is saddened to learn of the tragic death of Bobby East,” the organization that oversees stock car racing said. “We extend our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Bobby, a true racer”.</p><h3><strong>NASCAR Driver Bobby East Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Bobby East, the NASCAR driver, had accumulated a whopping net worth of around $10 million.</p><p>He made three attempts to qualify for NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races in 2005, but only one of them was successful. In that race, Bobby finally crashed his car. A few weeks later, Bobby raced in Memphis in the No. 46 for ST Motorsports to make his NASCAR Busch Series debut. He did well, finishing 17th.</p><p>According to racing-reference.info, a website that keeps track of NASCAR history, he competed in races in the Xfinity Series in 2005, 2007, and 2008. According to the website, he also competed in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series in 2005, 2006, and 2008.</p><p>Bobby participated in numerous United States Auto Club, or USAC, events, and series to hone his driving skills. He claimed 56 victories total at events sanctioned by USAC, the organization said in a statement. He also owns three USAC national championships, the most recent of which he won in 2013.</p><p>Tony Stewart Racing, the organization led by NASCAR great Tony Stewart, was his team at the time, according to NASCAR. He also participated in racing for RFK Racing, formerly known as Roush Fenway Racing. On Saturday, the organization tweeted: “Our team is incredibly sad to learn today’s news about Bobby East.” Brad Keselowski, a NASCAR Cup champion and owner of RFK Racing, tweeted, “The news of this murder is Tragic and wrong.” “He and his family were true racers. Prayers for justice and peace.”</p><p>Also, Bobby East became the organization’s youngest national feature race winner at the time in 2001 with his maiden victory with the USAC National Midgets, according to USAC. He was 16.</p><p>Because of his winning 2004 season on Team Lewis, where he finished first overall in his No. 9 car, he earned the nickname “Beast” among his devoted fans. This nickname is an amalgamation of the first letter of his first name, “B,” and his last name, “East.” It is unlike his kind demeanor and character to those who know him.</p><h3><strong>Did NASCAR Driver Bobby East Leave Behind A Girlfriend?</strong></h3><p>No, NASCAR Driver Bobby East didn’t leave behind a girlfriend. He maintained a dating life away from the limelight so there is no information on his girlfriend or wife. So, based on that, we believe he was single unless otherwise.</p><h3><strong>NASCAR Driver Bobby East Age At The Time Of His Death</strong></h3><p>Born on 17 December 1984, NASCAR Driver Bobby East was 37 at the time of his death.</p><h3><strong>NASCAR Driver Bobby East Family</strong></h3><p>Bobby East was born to USAC Hall of Fame car builder Bob East and his wife Janice. In 2022, his father is 70 years old meanwhile his mother is 69. Bob was famed midget, sprint, and silver crown car builder Bob East, a member of the USAC Hall of Fame. In 2004 at the USAC National Midget Series, Bob Sr. developed the chassis for the Steve Lewis Racing No. 9 that his son raced to victory.</p><p>Besides his parents, Bobby had two sisters; Amy East and Alison East.</p><p>Amy was a former Craftsman Truck pit reporter. She appeared on ESPN Speedworld at USAC Midgets/Western Sprints in 2002. She married stock car racing driver Terry Cook in a private ceremony held at the Paris hotel on 6 December 2000. The wedding vows were followed by a reception and dinner hosted by the bride’s parents, Bob and Janice East. The newlyweds left on a honeymoon trip to Maui the day after the Las Vegas wedding ceremony. Upon their return, the couple lived in Indianapolis, IN.</p><p>Moreover, Terry said, “On the personal side, my life has never been better. Amy has been totally supportive of my career and is a great sounding board for the different opportunities I’ve had to consider. Growing up in motorsports with her dad’s Beast Chassis business, Amy has a great appreciation for what I go through in pursuing my career. Amy has been invaluable in helping me make the right decisions. Hopefully, we’ll have some decisions to make right after the holidays”.</p><p>Alison East (born 10 April 1978), Bobby’s other sister, was married to driver <a href=#>Jason Leffler</a>.
