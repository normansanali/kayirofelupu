Still, if you know where to look and what to look for, you can find a pair that’s dry, warm, and supportive all at the same time. According to podiatric surgeon <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dana Canuso</a>, since plantar fasciitis is caused by inflammation along the bottom of the foot, a well-designed <a href=# class=T3D>insole</a> and the right size interior can provide comfortable support.</p><p>First, let’s talk about the insole. An insole is the piece of material that stretches along the bottom interior of the shoe and cushions the foot. Also referred to as “footbeds” or “orthotic inserts” (when removable), this part of the shoe should be <a href=# class=T3D>supportive and shock-absorbing</a> if you have plantar fasciitis. “The insole should have some rigidity with a prominent arch. It should also be strong enough to not flatten under the weight of the person standing on it,” Dr. Canuso wrote to Bustle. Most best-selling <a href=# class=T3D>orthopedic shoes</a> use materials like foam, gel, and EVA, and their insoles are typically thicker and more contoured than less-supportive options.</p><p>Those with plantar fasciitis also often find that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>narrow shoes contribute to pain and inflammation</a>, so a roomier boot is recommended — but don’t go too wide. “In the short term, wider/bigger shoes are comfortable for those with plantar fasciitis because swelling can occur and any pressure on a swollen fascia can become painful. In the long term, however, plantar fascitis can actually worsen over time if a wearer's shoes are too big and wide,” Dr. Canuso wrote. If you have wider feet, this could mean opting for a similarly <a href=# class=T3D>wide boot</a> with a naturally roomier design, or it could mean sizing up or outward. A lot of the pairs below feature both half sizes and wide options, so you can find a size that provides you with the room you need.</p><p>These <a href=# class=T3D>winter boots</a> are supportive and come with five-star reviews from real buyers who have plantar fasciitis.</p><h2>1. The Overall Best Orthopedic Winter Boots For Plantar Fasciitis</h2><p>This pair of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>orthopedic boots from Orthofeet</a> is designed with foot-health in mind. First, the insoles feature multiple layers of pillow-like cushioning and anatomical arch support (and they’re removable should you want to add your own orthotics). Second, the boots have an extra-roomy toe box and easy-to-adjust straps for a personalized fit. Plus, you can opt for half sizes, wide sizes, and extra-wide sizes. The suede uppers and faux-fur cuffs make them well-suited for cold months, while the textured sole prevents slipping.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 2</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 12 (medium, wide, and X-wide)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “I have a bad case of [plantar fasciitis] and these boots seem to give me great support as well as cushioning for my heel pain. They may be pricey but when [you’re] suffering from pain it's worth every penny. The boots are stylish and have held up great!”</p><h2>2. The Best Budget Boots For Plantar Fasciitis</h2><p>In terms of affordable fashion boots, DREAM PAIRS are about as comfortable and stylish as you can get for the price point. Like many other <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>knee-high boots</a>, they have a buckle, zipper, leather-like exterior, but they set themselves apart with a thicker outsole and a more supportive interior. They also feature a faux-fur cuff and come in several designs and colors. (For thicker socks or your own inserts, it’s recommended that you go up half a size.)</p><ul><li>Available colors: 8</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 11</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “I love them. These are the most warm and comfortable boots I own. I have plantar fasciitis and my feet didn’t hurt at all wearing them all day long in the mountains. Great purchase!”</p><h2>3. The Podiatrist’s Pick: The Best Hiking Boots</h2><p>For more demanding activities, you’ll need something that's dependably warm, supportive, and well-suited for uneven terrain. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Columbia’s Newton Ridge boots</a> are a best-seller in the category of women’s hiking boots on Amazon, and they have garnered more than 30,000 ratings and an overall 4.7-star average. Dr. Canuso also wrote, “I love these boots because they are waterproof, lightweight, and the way they lace up helps support each wearer's specific foot type perfectly.” Yes, they have waterproof full-grain leather for dryness, mesh interior lining for breathability, and extremely textured outsoles for nonslip gripping — but the real selling point? Their insole is thick, durable, and cushioning, a great combo for those with plantar fasciitis. They’re also available in half sizes and wide options.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 24</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 12 (medium and wide)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “Nice material and quality craftsmanship. I used them right out of the box to hike Fall Creek Falls in TN. Many wet rocks, rough terrain, steep declines and inclines. I have plantar fasciitis and these boots did not hurt my feet at all even after a 3 hour hike. Good grips on soles, snug fit and comfortable. Feet were warm and dry but not overly hot.”</p><h2>4. The Best Tall Boots That Can Handle Snow</h2><p>If snowy weather is common for your particular climate, these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ice Maiden II boots from Columbia</a> are an ideal option for a few reasons: They’re waterproof, warm, lightweight, and supportive. The interior features faux-fur insulation along with a lightweight but well-cushioned Techlite insole. On the outside, you’ll find a thick rubber outsole for reliable traction, adjustable laces for the best possible fit, and waterproof leather and textile that reaches mid-calf to keep snow out. The boots come in half and wide sizes.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 9</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 12 (medium and wide)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “It's been two years and these boots are a winter favorite of mine and still in good condition. I have found them to be warm and durable and very waterproof...I am now looking at getting a second pair because I love them so much. I have plantar fasciitis and these boots don't exacerbate it, which is nice. These were comfortable right from the start and had no break in period.”</p><h2>5. The Most Stylish Ankle Boots For Plantar Fasciitis</h2><p>These <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Propét Delaney boots</a> are definitely stylish enough to pair with your work attire or going-out wardrobe, thanks to their fashion laces and ankle-bootie design in your choice of 10 different suede or leather colors. That said, they’re also well-suited for winter because of their Nylex lining, a material that’s known for<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> wicking away moisture</a> to keep you dry, and Scotchgard protectant, which repels water and stains. Finally, to keep those with plantar fasciitis comfortable, they have a thick EVA insole and come in a variety of widths ranging up to 2X-wide.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 10</li><li>Available sizes: 6 — 11 (medium, wide, X-wide, and XX-wide)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “I love these boots so much and I get compliments all the time. I have plantar fasciitis and on a normal day the support is adequate, but if I were going to be on my feet all day I might want a little more support. The insoles are removable so you can use orthotics. My only complaint is that they get dirty easily, at least in the light beige color I got. Still, cute and comfortable.”</p><h2>6. The Best Rain Boots For Plantar Fasciitis</h2><p>Typically, galoshes or wellies keep your feet dry enough when it's wet outside, but they rarely offer much in the way of support or warmth — <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Muck's Arctic Adventure boots</a> are the exception. They’re made from 100% rubber and reach up to the knee to keep moisture out, but they also have a contoured bottom and thick but lightweight insole to absorb shock and adjust to the shape of your feet. They’re even lined with fleece to provide way more warmth than your average rain boot.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 8</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 11</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “I have high arches and am prone to plantar fasciitis...It's now early May. I have worn these boots for a good part of the day almost every day since I got them in January. They were great in snow in ice in the winter and in the spring mud. They are still comfortable and show no signs of wear. Good quality boots. I highly recommend them.”</p><h2>7. The Best Casual Boots To Slip On</h2><p>For quick errands, grabbing the mail, or taking the dog outside, turn to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Skechers’s Joy Chukka</a><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> boots</a> to slip on and go. Even though they slip right on (thanks to their zipper-, buckle-, and lace-less design), they still provide great support with their responsive insole and cushioning. Finally, since they’re lined with fake fur and treated with Scotchguard, they’re well-suited for cold and wet winter months. They’re so comfortable, some reviewers even opt to wear them around the house.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 9</li><li>Available sizes: 5 — 12 (medium and wide)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “Great boots that I slip on and off between yoga classes and dog walking. It has been below freezing where I live and these shoes are great with thick socks. They are VERY comfortable and waterproof. I can walk all day in them and they have nice support.”</p><h2>8. A Podiatrist’s Pick For The Warmest Boots</h2><p>According to Dr. Canuso, “The insulation on these shoes really helps keep feet warm in the winter. Keen is known for their heavy duty, high-quality products and these are no exception.” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Keen’s Revel 3 hiking boots</a> are made from 100% leather with a stay-dry membrane and plush padding for warmth and comfort. The exterior is made to handle ice and snow thanks to the grippy, highly textured rubber bottom, and they’re supportive thanks to their structured insole, high ankle, and adaptive laces.</p><ul><li>Available colors: 2</li><li>Available sizes: 7 — 14 (men’s)</li></ul><p><strong>A helpful review</strong>: “Good boots. I bought them without much time for break in before a hiking trip. Hiked about 70 miles in them over a week. They were great. Comfy, supportive, and waterproof when hiking through some sloppy snow and mud.”</p><p>Expert:</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dana Canuso</a>, podiatric surgeon and the founder of Dr. Canuso Skincare</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on March 24, 2021</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeSmsC1edaipa2domKvsLvTrGSfp6Jiva2tza2Yq2WWlsCktcitoKw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./crossword-the-rom-com-puzzle-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Rom-Com Puzzle">&larr;
