But more than that and everything he loves basketball. Yes, it is one of the athletes of Netflix’s Last Chance U: Basketball Season 2 we speak of.</p><p>In the 13 December 2022-released second installment of the series, a whole new roster of players was introduced to viewers for the 2021-2022 session. One of them was Damani. So, let us tell you who he is and what he has been up to since&nbsp;Last Chance U, in this writing called ‘Damani Whitlock Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Damani Whitlock On Netflix’s Last Chance U: Basketball Season 2</strong></h3><p>Damani Whitlock’s inclusion in the team seemed somewhat unsafe at the start. But, he made a comeback which left the viewers in awe.</p><p>This is how Damani’s story plays out in the series. This documentary goes on to tell the success story of St. Anthony High School and Scale Prep Academy former alum in this way. A multi-sports fanatic Damani becomes a student at the University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH), an NCAA Division II institute in 2018. During the 2018-2019 session, he gets to partake in four games as a freshman. But, right then, an injury stops him.</p><p>After recovery, he was able to get his freshman year back. And so he was back in the field. He dominated the 2019-2020 season and was part of every one of the 26 games that the Vulcans played. At UHH, Damani was at the same time pursuing a degree in Mathematics. Then, when the Covid-19 global pandemic happened, he had to shift back home to help his father.</p><p>Later, during the 2021-2022 session, as Damani gets ready to show his skills at ELAC Huskies, just after his recruitment, he becomes ill feeling uncomfortable in the area near his heart. Fortunately, his heart gets diagnosed as structurally and functionally fine, so Damani returns again to put the ball in the basket.
