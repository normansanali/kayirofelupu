From being a highly touted prospect to battling injuries and transitioning positions, Profar's journey in Major League Baseball (MLB) has been eventful. Let's take a closer look at what has happened to Jurickson Profar throughout his career.</p><h2>Early Life and MLB Debut</h2><p>Born on February 20, 1993, in Willemstad, Cura√ßao, Jurickson Profar was introduced to organized baseball at a young age. His talent and potential led him to sign with the Texas Rangers in 2009. Profar quickly climbed the ranks in the Rangers' farm system, showcasing his skills and earning recognition as one of the top prospects in baseball.</p><p>Profar made his MLB debut with the Texas Rangers in 2012, stepping onto the field as a highly anticipated young player. He displayed versatility by playing multiple positions, including shortstop, second base, and third base.</p><h2>Ups and Downs in Career</h2><p>Despite his promising start, Profar faced setbacks in the form of injuries. A shoulder injury caused him to miss the entire 2014 and 2015 seasons, hindering his progression. However, he made a strong comeback in 2016, batting .239 with 5 home runs and 20 RBIs in 90 games for the Rangers.</p><p>In 2019, the Rangers traded Profar to the Oakland Athletics. The change of scenery allowed him to showcase his skills in a new environment. He became an important contributor to the Athletics, displaying his versatility by playing multiple positions once again.</p><p>The San Diego Padres acquired Profar in 2020. This move marked a transition in his career, as he shifted from a utility infielder to an outfielder. Profar embraced the change and continued to provide value to his team.</p><h2>Injury and Hospitalization</h2><p>In a recent incident, Jurickson Profar suffered a concussion and cervical strain during a collision with teammate C.J. Abrams while playing for the San Diego Padres. The impact of the collision resulted in his hospitalization. Fortunately, no fractures or major injuries were detected, allowing him to be discharged from the hospital.</p><p>Although Profar's injuries were significant, the team considers themselves fortunate that the situation wasn't worse. He will undergo concussion protocols to ensure his safety and well-being. The Padres will certainly miss his contributions on the field, particularly his league-leading outfield assists.</p><h2>Career Achievements and Future</h2><p>Throughout his career, Jurickson Profar has demonstrated his ability to contribute in various roles and positions. His versatility and defensive skills have made him a valuable asset to his teams.</p><p>In 2022, Profar had a career-high in plate appearances and hits, showcasing his potential as a consistent performer. Despite the challenges he has faced, Profar has remained resilient and determined to make an impact.</p><p>As a free agent at the time of writing, Profar's future in MLB is uncertain. However, his track record and versatility make him an attractive option for teams in need of a reliable outfielder or utility player.</p><p>Jurickson Profar's career has been a rollercoaster ride filled with ups and downs. From his early days as a highly touted prospect to battling injuries and transitioning positions, he has shown resilience and adaptability. While his recent collision and subsequent injuries have temporarily sidelined him, his impact on the field and versatility cannot be overlooked. As he continues his journey in professional baseball, fans and teams alike will be eager to see what lies ahead for this talented outfielder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqvB0aKapKufo3qxvs6fmKs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-price-of-pumpkins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the price of pumpkins?">&larr;
