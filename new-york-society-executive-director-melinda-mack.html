Somebody is Native American or a descendent. Polynesian I’m hearing Hawaiian. Asian, Vikings. Somebody’s ancestral team is very cultured. Somebody also is bilingual; someone is mixed rave or multiracial; somebody also discovers they’re biracial or mixed with something they family never told them about. This can even be a bloodline that isn’t known because they were wiped out from a part of history. Somebody is helping to cherish someone’s memory and protect a legacy. Restore the beauty. Somebody has ancestors that got involved in some nasty stuff; someone is responsible for a lot of killings or having them ordered to be killed. Somebody was a general. A Commander in Chief; I’m also hearing War Hero. Somebody can be a veteran or is currently serving in the military. Somebody lives for this though. They like blood and violence. They prefer the easy way because they’re trying to turn over a new leaf; but when their baby call them crying they not only show up but this is somebody who will show out. This person will fight an entire army of people by themselves that’s the attitude it’s giving me. They don’t have to because someone is strong and they’re a leader. Fierce warrior with the respect from their people who were and are happy to fight along side of them. Somebody prayers definitely have been heard and answered. The petitions and all of that. They got them. I’m hearing, “Look for the signs. Watch me. They’re everywhere.” No matter where somebody goes or who they’re with they will always be protected. Somebody standing ten toes down. They’re solid. Doves are significant. Birds. Crows, Hawks, Eagles, Seagull. Messengers. Somebody wanted to stop a person’s happiness. They didn’t want someone to have love; not even for themselves in fact that was the main problem someone had. Self love and a person’s character. Somebody is a class act. Rare gem. True beauty. Somebody hates how others speak about someone and seems to adore them. They flock to a person. Somebody a celebrity or in the spotlight to be admired. Celebrated. Somebody wanted the attention all for themselves. They got it. I heard, “It’s going to be a long, hot summer and an even colder winter.” Somebody also comes from a family of witch doctors, rootworkers, and people with different conjure methods. I heard, “Hex somebody using a shoe string.” Old school Hoodoo. Voodooist. Somebody is traditional in their workings and teachings. Somebody is learning from Spirit. Somebody is initiated in the Spirit. Exalted. I heard, “Can’t be touched. Not up for discussion.” The only person that can undo someone is they cause their own demise. Ancestors not about to let that happen; I heard, “I’ll knock all this shit over.” Somebody has worked too hard to be swayed or tempted. Somebody’s mission is too important. They have family and others counting on them. Cheering them on. Somebody is so precious to their ancestors and they’ll cause havoc and bring hell to anybody who tries to hurt them. Somebody also has already learned lessons that someone keeps trying to force them to repeat. Somebody ancestor doesn’t want them to make the same mistake they did. Abusing their gifts and attacking people they perceive weaker than them. They’ll intervene and be like, “Aht aht!” That’s why someone doesn’t argue or waste time because people that angry to curse someone out of jealousy are sick. Sometimes it’s necessary to teach people a lesson but someone already hanging on by a thread. <a title=blackhoodoowitch href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#blackhoodoowitch</a> <a title=fyptarot href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#fyptarot</a> <a title=fypage href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#fypage</a> <a title=oraclemessages href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#oraclemessages</a> <a title=collective href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#collective</a> <a title=allsigns href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#allsigns</a> <a title=ancestors href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#ancestors</a> <a title=ancestormessage href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#ancestormessage</a> <a title=ancestorsbaby href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#ancestorsbaby</a> <a title=hoodoowitchtok href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#hoodoowitchtok</a> <a title=hoodoo href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#hoodoo</a> <a title=voodoo href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#voodoo</a> <a title=witchtok href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#witchtok</a></p><p><a title="♬ Call Out My Name - The Weeknd" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">♬ Call Out My Name – The Weeknd</a></p><p>Introduction:<br>The sudden passing of Melinda Mack, the CEO of the New York Association of Employment and Training Professionals (NYATEP), has left a profound void in the workforce development industry.
