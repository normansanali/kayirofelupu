For the performance, she was even nominated for a SAG award, along with the cast in 2022. Karen has really been committed to her craft, over the course. But, she also has never taken a step back from her family, including her baby-father Adam Schartoff, about whom we shall now talk.</p><h3><strong>Meet Adam Schartoff, Karen Pittman’s Baby Father</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing, it was not known if Karen Pittman is married or not. But, we know that she has been linked to two men, who also happen to be the fathers of her kids. Adam Schartoff is the father of Karen’s older child, Jacob Pittman Schartoff, or just Jake. He turned 19 on 15 May 2023.</p><p>Like Karen, Adam is also very much fond of his son. Often on his birthdays, we have seen him gush about him. One time, for instance, he said on social media becoming Jake’s father is the greatest thing that’s happened in his life is becoming a dad. He has always been proud of the way his boy has turned out. He says Jake is someone he admires and often leaves him feeling awed. On his darkest days, Jake has lifted his spirits and provided countless hours of joy and laughter.</p><p>Per his IG <a href=#>@jakes_relendix</a>, Jake, in addition to being his dad’s “happy place” is an aspiring writer.</p><p>Adam also is in love with his ex-wife’s other kid, it seems. It is Karen’s other child, Lena Williams, we speak of. She is the daughter of Karen and actor Victor Williams (of The King of Queens). Lena has been less seen online as compared to her half-brother Jake.</p><p>Just on June (23rd) 2023, Adam took to social media to congratulate Lena on graduating. “Congratulations to dear Lena for graduating middle school today. Very proud of this young lady.”, he wrote next to a picture of Lena with Jake and her mother.</p><h3><strong>Adam Schartoff Relationship Status</strong></h3><p>Adam Schartoff was seemingly single and not committed to anyone as of June 2023.</p><h3><strong>Adam Schartoff Age</strong></h3><p>Adam Schartoff was born in 1963.

She reached the age of 86 in April 2023. She seemed to be calling Forest Hills, New York as of 2023. On 26 April 2022, Adam wished saying “Happy Birthday to my Mom, Julia Schartoff, who turns 85 today. xoxo”.</p><p>Adam’s father, Bob Schartoff, is, unfortunately, no more. On 6 August 2020, Adam wrote on a social media post that had his dad been still alive he would have become 84 on that day. He said his dad was a great son, brother, husband, uncle, friend, and father. He said a lot more about him before concluding with “A day doesn’t go by where I don’t think about him and miss him terribly. But I do have countless memories and they have become an especially great comfort.”</p><p>A year before in May, Bob was still alive it seems. They had together celebrated his and Julia’s 60th anniversary.</p><p>As for siblings, Adam has a sister and a brother. His sister is Jodi Schartoff Mullinax, a former alumnus of Hillcrest High School. She later studied Forensic Psychology at CUNY John Jay. She turned 63 years old in May 2023.
