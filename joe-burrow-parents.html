Now, he is preparing for his first Super Bowl appearance, and the pressure is truly on.</p><p>Many fans are familiar with who Joe is thanks to his skills on the field as well as some of his viral antics, but what is his home life like? Keep reading for a breakdown of who his parents are.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who are Joe Burrow's parents?</h2><p>Joe's parents truly helped him become the man that he is today. To understand who he is, it's important to unpack who his parents are and how they played a role in shaping his future. Joe's dad, James (Jimmy) Arthur Burrow, is a former all-star defensive back in the Canadian Football League as well as the NFL. Once his pro career ended, Jimmy became a college football coach, a job he has also since retired from. He has constantly shown support for Joe throughout his football career.</p><p>Joe's mother, Robin Burrow, the principal of Eastern Elementary School in Appalachian Meigs County, Ohio, has also been very supportive of him from day one. On top of her responsibilities as a school administrator, Robin is also a board member of the Appalachian Children's Coalition, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">group whose mission</a> is "to improve the health and well-being of our region's children."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joe Burrow (@joeyb_9)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jimmy and Robin have been very candid about what it is like being Joe's parents.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WAFB9</a>, the Burrows discussed what it's like being the parents of the biggest up-and-coming athlete in America ahead of his debut Super Bowl appearance.</p><p>On his son's now-famed coolness, Jimmy said, "I think it’s his confidence in himself and just his ability to be a football player. In all the other sports too. He was always confident."</p><p>Robin chimed in to say that Joe "has always been really focused on making sure that he’s prepared for whatever it is he’s getting ready to do, whether that was sports or academics or something else in life, and I think that just makes him confident."</p><p>As a former coach, Jimmy also has some advice for his son as he tackles the biggest game of his life.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joe Burrow (@joeyb_9)</a></p></figure><p>"It’s coaching clichés, but it usually is a big factor in wins and losses, and that’s protect the ball, make sure you don’t turn it over and make good decisions. That’s for him personally," the former Green Bay Packers team member told the news channel.</p><p>Joe's mother also has advice for her son. "My advice is definitely from a mom’s perspective. Enjoy the ride. Get out and have fun with your teammates ... and focus on the plan and be confident," she told the network.</p><p>Considering the young star's already remarkable track record in the NFL as well as prior to being drafted, it's only fair to assume that he's going to be giving it his all when he touches the turf for America's biggest game on Feb. 13, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymecGuqaunp2K9or7Ep6us</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-catherine-kasavuli-son-martin-kasavuli-meet-her-parents-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Catherine Kasavuli Son Martin Kasavuli?
