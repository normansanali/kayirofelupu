She made her acting debut in the drama film Rich and Famous in 1981, which marked the beginning of her career. In 1982, she became a cast member of the CBS soap serial As the World Turned.</p><p>Ithaca, a drama movie based on William Saroyan’s 1943 book The Human Comedy, marked Ryan’s debut as a filmmaker. It made its international debut in October at the Middleburg Film Festival and was filmed in Petersburg, Virginia.</p><h2><span id=What_Will_Meg_Ryan8217s_Net_Worth_Be_in_2023>What Will Meg Ryan’s Net Worth Be in 2023?</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Meg Ryan, an American actress, and producer, is expected to be worth $85 million.</p><p>She was one of the highest-paid actresses of her day and appeared in many high-budget movies during her career.</p><p>For her part in the historical drama Drama I.Q. in 1994, Meg got $5 million. She received $8.5 million in 1998 for her work in City of Angels. For her part in the movie, she received $10.5 million. She appeared in You’ve Got Mail the same year as Tom Hanks.</p><p>Meg spent several years living in a magnificent house in the Bel-Air district of Los Angeles.</p><p>She advertised the house for $14.2 million in 2009, and a buyer purchased it for $11.1 million. James Han, a filmmaker, paid $18.5 million for the House a while later.</p><h2><span id=Update_on_Meg_Ryan8217s_Health_Is_She_Ill>Update on Meg Ryan’s Health: Is She Ill?</span></h2><p>According to the July 25 edition of Star magazine, Meg Ryan is having trouble making ends meet because of a variety of health problems. Meg has been heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>She has recently had a lot of discomfort and several sleepless nights. She’s not eating or sleeping, which is aggravating her health problems, a source tells the magazine.</p><p>She has been in treatment with her doctor, which has helped her reclaim her sleeping patterns and stop having anxiety attacks from her dreams, and as a result, she is better. When compared to women her age, she is doing well.</p><p>Although she was a well-known actress, she lost some of her notoriety in the 2000s and 2010s. Meg Ryan is a name that very few people in today’s age are acquainted with. This is a result of the former actress’ absence from major motion pictures.</p><p>One of the primary reasons she didn’t appear beyond a certain age was that she was a victim of Hollywood ageism.</p><p>In addition, she became known as the Scarlet Woman due to her industry activities, and the parts she played to challenge the stereotype all helped to diminish her notoriety.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Meg_Ryan_fare_What_Made_Her_Stop_Acting>How did Meg Ryan fare?
