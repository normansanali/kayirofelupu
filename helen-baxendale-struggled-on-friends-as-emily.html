We can only imagine how Helen Baxendale was feeling prior to her start on <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>. When she joined, the show was exploding in terms of its popularity. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Friends Took Heat And Was Viewed As Desperate Following Winona Ryder's Controversial Cameo</a></span>We'll take a look at her time on sitcom as Emily Waltham and what went on behind the scenes. Although the role changed her career, it wasn't as exhilarating for the actress behind the scenes and in her personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-baxendale-called-her-time-on-friends-a-strange-dream>Helen Baxendale Called Her Time On Friends 'A Strange Dream'</h2><p>Helen Baxendale took part in 14 episodes of Friends, taking on the role of Emily Waltham. <a href=#>Given that she came in the way of Ross and Rachel</a>, her character wasn't necessarily loved.</p><p>In addition, Helen would reveal that although she got along with the cast, <a href=#>everything was very professional and not as 'friendly'</a> as the title of the show suggests...</p><p>"They were all very nice and professional. We were never great mates though. People expect because it is called 'Friends' that everyone was great friends, but they were real professionals. They'd been doing it for years and I was one of many guest stars to appear," the actress stated alongside Mirror.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>A 27-Second Ovation From The Studio Audience On Friends Changed Everything For Chandler And Monica's Romance Storyline</a></span></p><p>Looking back, Helen is proud of her time on the show, though she feels as though it isn't a part of her life, nor career. Instead, looking back, Helen calls it something similar to a dream, "I am very proud and delighted to have been in such an amazingly successful and international show."</p><p>"It's always a talking point and it was a very clever set up - even now young people especially seem to love it.</p><p>But it doesn't feel like part of my life at all now.

Baxendale got glimpse of this early on, as her fame grew while the paparazzi also took an interest in her personal life.</p><p>"The only adverse thing was for a short a period the paparazzi followed my friends and family around."</p><p>Helen would further reveal alongside Virgin Radio<a href=#>that the main cast was hounded by media at the time.</a> It was all too much for the actress.</p><p>"But I saw those people in Friends, for example, and thought, 'I don’t think that life is really what I want.' They were hounded. They weren’t able to walk into a supermarket and buy something."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I didn’t think what I was doing warranted [all the attention]. It wasn’t about me, it was about this... this thing. This programme that I happened to be in for a few episodes. The whole thing was bonkers.”</p><p>“Attention and press still doesn’t sit well with me, but… I suppose I’ve been quite prepared to deal with it to get good parts.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Friends Guest-Star Needed To Re-Shoot All His Scenes Due To How Loud The Live Audience Would Get</a></span></p><p>There really is no debating as to how the actress felt, David Schwimmer echoed this sentiment following his time on Friends, stating that it was traumatizing to go out and constantly get noticed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Helen got a snippet of this and decided to take her career in a different direction.</p><h2 id=helen-baxendale-took-her-career-in-a-different-direction-following-friends>Helen Baxendale Took Her Career In A Different Direction Following Friends</h2><p>Following her time on Friends, Helen did not continue on over in the United States, her career continued on overseas. Yes, the fame was a lot to handle but Helen admits this decision wasn't done by choice, as roles in the US just weren't available after the show.</p><p>"I don't have any regrets whatsoever because it has been my life. I've been very privileged, I'm lucky and I'm still alive.</p><p>I've pursued every avenue open to me ever, so I don't really understand the idea that I walked away from opportunities. No other jobs came up! It was a job and not a life change I went and did the job and came home."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the age of 52, <a href=#>the actress is still very much active</a>, appearing on the TV series Noughts + Crosses.
