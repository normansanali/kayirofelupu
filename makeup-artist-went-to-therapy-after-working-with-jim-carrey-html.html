A makeup artist on one of Carrey’s most popular films had a particularly difficult time working with him. Ultimately, the <a href=#>makeup</a> artist did get a huge favor from the studio because of the whole ordeal, however, working on the film caused him to go to therapy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jim-carrey-with-a-banana.jpg><h2>How Jim Carrey behaved on the set of one of his most popular films</h2><p id=par-2_41>Carey has played a number of likable characters on screen. However, makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji told <a href=#>Vulture</a> that Carrey was very mean on the set of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. This is interesting, given how the Grinch is very disagreeable.</p><p id=par-3_64>“Once we were on set, he was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn’t finish,” Tsuji said. “After two weeks we only could finish three days’ worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn’t shoot anything.” Tsuji remembered how Carrey took issue with him specifically.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>A trailer for the film</figure><p id=par-4_57>“In the makeup trailer he just suddenly stands up and looks in the mirror, and pointing on his chin, he goes, ‘This color is different from what you did yesterday,’” Tsuji recalled. “I was using the same color I used yesterday. He says, ‘Fix it.’ And okay, you know, I ‘fixed’ it. Every day was like that.”</p><h2>Why Kazuhiro Tsuji came back to the film after leaving it</h2><p id=par-5_47>Tsuji left the production of the film to make Carrey realize he was an important part of the film’s production. Two weeks later, Carrey asked him to work on How the Grinch Stole Christmas again. Tsuji had an idea for how the studio could help him out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/max-and-grinch.jpg><p id=par-6_59>“I went back under one condition,” Tsuji said. “I was talking with my friends, and they all told me, ‘You should ask for a raise before you go back.’ I didn’t want to do that — kind of nasty.” Ultimately, Tsuji wanted the studio to help him get his green card — a fitting request given the Grinch’s complexion.</p><p id=par-7_56>Tsuji was able to get his green card. He would later see How the Grinch Stole Christmas as a turning point in his life as the production of the film caused him to go to therapy. Subsequently, Tsuji had a notable cinematic career, working on films like Darkest Hour and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kazuhiro-Tsuji.jpg><p id=par-8_14>RELATED: <strong><a href=#>Why Jim Carrey Rejected the Prestigious Opportunity to Play Lead in ‘Doctor Who’</a></strong></p><h2>How the public reacted to ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas’</h2><p id=par-9_79>According to <a href=#>Box Office Mojo</a>, How the Grinch Stole Christmas earned over $345 million at the box office. It’s arguably eclipsed Dr. Seuss’ original book and the 1960s television special in popularity. More recently, audiences saw a new animated version of the tale and that film may not have been made if not for the wild success of Carrey’s version. How the Grinch Stole Christmas clearly resonated with audiences — even if it was a difficult film to make.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6orfErqdmmaKptrTAjLCcp6xdqbxuwMeeqZqoqWKup8DEq2Swp6Kgtq%2BzjLCgraBdn7auecKaqaudqWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./braless-stars-over-40-pics-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Photos Of Jennifer Lopez &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">&larr;
