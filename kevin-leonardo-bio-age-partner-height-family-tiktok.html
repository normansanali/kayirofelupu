He gained enormous views on the video by mooning his viewers. So naturally, many of the viewers wish to learn more about the man behind who made the bold video.</p><p>This brief bio might be of assistance. Here we discuss information about his partner, family, and his career.</p><h3><strong>Why Did Kevin Leonardo Go Viral?</strong></h3><p>People go viral on the internet for various reasons, and Kevin Leonardo had his shining moment when he shared a tutorial video where he demonstrates his butt hair removal using NAIR cream.</p><p>The in-issue video was published on the YouTuber’s channel a week ago and has already received 3.8 million views. The YouTuber is seen showing how to remove hair from his behind, but he displays much more than most viewers anticipated. Several social media users are still reeling over the footage. Even one Twitter user listed the film among their “top 3 scary short films.”</p><p>The title of the two minutes and 54-second-long YouTube video is ‘Removing BUTT Hairs Using NAIR Cream – A Visual Guide!’. Indeed, it is highly visual. The video’s creator introduces it by saying, “So this is how hairy my butt is right now.” Then his behind is shockingly and uneditedly shown to fans.</p><p>Many viewers will undoubtedly get a jump scare after seeing the YouTuber, so to speak, butt-naked. He then shows himself putting the Nair Body Cream hair removal to his behind after squeezing the product out of the bottle.</p><p>The purpose of the film is to show how well the Nair lotion removes hair from our posterior and underarm areas. The designer removes everything after three minutes of timing. He then continues to demonstrate how it is maintained. In order to demonstrate the outcome to his viewers, he also takes a shower and then exposes his behind immediately after.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Kevin Leonardo Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Leonardo’s net worth is under $150 thousand. He attended Gabrielino High School and graduated from the <span class=xt0psk2>University of California, Irvine in 2022, with a double major in Film & Television and Advertising.</span></p><p>He posts TikTok videos about my personal life on the side to my 175K+ followers.</p><p>Furthermore, his goal is to “be able to start a successful business and advertise my products on social media. I’ve gotten a couple of brand deals for my TikTok, but I want to take my platform even further.”</p><p>Per his LinkedIn, he started working as a Sales Representative at AroundCampus Group in 2017. He also got a job as Sales Associate at Sunglass Hut.</p><p>Other jobs of Kevin include working as Programming Intern at NewFilmmakers Los Angeles (NFMLA), Customer Service Representative at Urban Outfitters, Film Development Intern at State Street Pictures, and Marketing Intern at Water Hero.</p><p>He was most recently working as Account Strategist at Adlab before he devoted his full time as a content creator.</p><h3><strong>Kevin Leonardo Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Kevin Leonardo is 25 years old. He was born in 1998.</p><h3><strong>Kevin Leonardo Family</strong></h3><p>Kevin Leonardo is the son of Vera Wang. In early July 2023, Kevin celebrated Vera’s birthday.</p><p>By taking it to Instagram, Kevin wished his mom, “I’m the luckiest person in the world to be able to call this woman my mom‼️ Happy birthday, <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@thevvlife</a> I truly cannot put into words how much u mean to me and how much I love you 💖 praying that we have a million more birthdays to celebrate, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!”</p><p>There isn’t much about his dad. But in June 2021, on Father’s Day, Kevin shared that his father died in 2005 at the age of 36 due to a heart attack. He added, “It makes me happy seeing other people post about their dads, especially the ones I know personally 🤗 I hope y’all have a good day with your dads! And if ur fatherless like me, it’s ok ❤️.”</p><p>It was after his father’s death, Kevin and his family arrived in the US from Indonesia. They lived in a one-bedroom apartment for years.</p><p>Vera worked “three different jobs at once, went to adult school to get her GED, and did a bunch of other tough sh*ts.” He added in the Mother’s Day post, “Now, she has her own lit house that she always remodels (I still hate Glendora) and works from home every day to run her own successful business. my mom is the most hardworking and strongest person I know, and im so proud of her. Happy Mother’s Day to the woman that makes everything possible for me.”</p><h3><strong>What Is Kevin Leonardo Height?</strong></h3><p>Kevin Leonardo’s height measures about 5 feet 8 inches.</p><h3><strong>Kevin Leonardo Partner</strong></h3><p>Kevin Leonardo is gay and has shared his dating history on his socials. In March 2021, Kevin shared that he was writing in his diary about the guy that he was in love with since he met him. But in the summer of 2020, he started writing songs about him.</p><p>Kevin’s alleged partner is likely named Anush Gupta who frequently appears on his IG. On Anush’s birthday in September 2022, Kevin wished him via an IG post writing, “Happy birthday to this crazy !! U something but I love u 5ever and ever 🥸😀❤️❤️ 6 years and counting 🫣💩🤮 ily soooo much 😀😀💋💋🎁 BIRTHDAY BITCH !!! 🎁💋🎂🎉🎉🎉🎊💩🧼😽🫣.”</p><p>While they appeared together in March 2023, it is unclear if they are still together. But then again, they could also be very good friends and not romantic partners which could only mean that Kevin is keeping his partner out of the public eye.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Kevin Leonardo Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kevin Leonardo celebrates his birthday on 16 March.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Kevin Leonardo From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Kevin Leonardo is residing in <span class=xt0psk2>San Gabriel, California.
