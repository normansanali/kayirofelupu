Stay on the phone for as long as you possibly can, maybe even ask her if you can record the conversation. When you talk- Thank her over and over again for being your mom. Tell her you know she did her best, and her best was more than enough- in fact, it was perfect. Thank her for helping you become the person you are today. Tell her that you hope you’re making her proud,” Brynn wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Because one day… you will feel how I do today. The day you have to endure your first Mother’s Day without her. Your first Mother’s Day where you can’t call her, you can’t send her a card, you can’t buy her flowers,” she continued. “And let me to tell you: your heart is going to ache in ways, and in places, and in depths, that you never knew it could.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Her Bravo bio states that Darelene taught Brynn “invaluable lessons about navigating life, owning her narrative as a bi-racial woman, and the true meaning of hard work.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brynn has not spoken much about her biracial background, but she does share a reminder of it every so often when she posts a pic or video of her gorgeous natural hair <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on the ‘gram</a>, as seen below.</p><h2>Brynn Is A College Graduate</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Brynn graduated from Indiana’s Purdue University with a bachelor’s degree in communications, public relations, and advertising and a minor in political science, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a> page.

In 2019, she revealed she became a yoga teacher after completing a 200-hour yoga training course through YogaWorks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Alongside a photo of her certificate, Brynn revealed what kind of yoga practitioner she is. “my teaching style is pretty chill. At Brynn Yoga, we sprinkle in a lot of jokes. We put as much thought in to our playlists as we do our sequencing..Our favorite pose is śavāsana,” she noted. “We like group hugs, activating that heart chakra … and ALL body types + skill levels are welcome.” She also said that she only planned on giving private yoga classes every so often, but not regularly.</p><h2>Brynn Is A World-Traveler</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>When you’ve gained as much success in your career as Brynn, it’s likely you’ll have some disposable income.
