Whether these films were <a href=#>for men</a>, <a href=#>women</a>, or for <a href=#>everyone to enjoy together</a>, there is simply no denying that the decade was able to bring to life some films that helped push the industry in a new direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Revenge of the Nerds was one of the biggest surprise hits of the decade, and it wound up spawning a franchise after taking the box office by storm. At one point, a remake had begun filming, but it was cancelled shortly after shooting began.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what happened to the cancelled Revenge of the Nerds remake.</p><h2 id=lsquo-revenge-of-the-nerds-rsquo-is-an-80s-classic>‘Revenge Of The Nerds’ Is An 80s Classic</h2><p>The 80s gave way to a number of classic comedy movies that have been able to stand the test of time. Yes, many of these movies are problematic and would need some major changes to be made today, but this does not change the fact that many flicks from the decade are still loved by fans. One such movie is Revenge of the Nerds, which was released back in 1984.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie had a stellar cast, who played their roles to perfection, and they helped bring out the best of the script. There are some things in this movie that will make modern audiences cringe and outright question how they made this movie in the first place, but the film ultimately became a success at the box office.</p><p>After the success of the film, and entire Nerds franchise was off and running. There would be three sequel films made as the years went on, the final two being television movies. There was even an attempt at making a television series, though that fell through. Eventually, more than two decades after the original, a remake was put into production by Fox Atomic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why Kevin Bacon's 'The Following' Was Cancelled After 3 Seasons</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-remake-with-adam-brody-was-in-the-works>A Remake With Adam Brody Was In The Works</h2><p>During the 2000s, Revenge of the Nerds was set to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make a return</a> to the big screen in remake form, and there was a belief that a modern take on the franchise could make some noise with fans. It’s incredibly difficult to pull off a successful remake, but clearly, the studio thought that they had something great in the works.</p><p>Performers like Adam Brody, Dan Byrd, and Katie Cassidy were all attached to the project, and it was set to be directed by Kyle Newman. That is a solid amount of talent, and with backing by Fox Atomic, things appeared to be ready for the film to hit the ground running and to get onto the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Filming would eventually get underway in Atlanta, but this is when things really started to fall apart for the project. Initially, there were some problems with the filming spot, as the swap in locations caused some issues, largely due to the size of the set being too small at the Agnes Scott College campus. Turns out, the filming location was only one of the problems taking place.</p><p>From seemingly out of nowhere, the plug was pulled on the remake just a few weeks into production.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why Manifest Was Cancelled</a></span></p><h2 id=why-it-was-cancelled>Why It Was Cancelled</h2><p>So, was the filming location the sole reason this remake was canceled? Unfortunately, the dailies weren’t inspiring, and it caused studio execs to shut things down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Variety, “People close to the film say another issue was that Fox Atomic topper Peter Rice was not completely satisfied with the dailies and that the film felt smaller than the kind of pic he’s aiming to release from Atomic, the teen-oriented label launched last year.”</p><p>Rice himself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a>, saying, “Everybody has worked really hard on Revenge of the Nerds, and we’re all disappointed that we can’t move forward.”</p><p>Once production stopped, it never got going again.</p><p>Spokespersons Isabel White said, “The whole production was standing by, and it was unlikely we were going to be able to get anything going until after the holidays. Given the pressures surrounding the film, it felt like we were trying to put a square peg in a round hole.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Arthur’s' Cancellation After 25 Years Has Left Its Adult Fans Furious</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like that, the project was shut down after a few weeks of filming. It’s incredibly rare to see the plug pulled on a flick like that, but whatever was being captured each day on set just wasn’t up to snuff for the studio. The Nerds brand still has a legacy, so perhaps it was best for things to simply not work out. Another remake is apparently in the works, and hopefully, this one will fare better than the 2006 remake attempt.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>HBO Max Users Threaten To Cancel Their Subscription Over 'The Prince'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6GdXaeyt7HNoJxmp5ZiwamxjKecq5yjYr%2BmucCknGavkah6pK3NnJylpJWZeri0yKWcZp6ZobqqusZo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./watch-crisis-infinite-earths-streaming.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How To Watch Crisis On Infinite Earths On Streaming">&larr;
