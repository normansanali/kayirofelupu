Diddy and Cameron Diaz have denied that they were an "item" multiple times. Although the famous 50 Cents singer has had his fair share of conquests, and Cameron has had her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own long list of beaux</a>, it seems like the two were an on and off thing for years! And yet both P. Diddy and Cameron, as well as their reps, have claimed that they were “just friends” on multiple occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But were they really telling the truth? Or was there more to their frequent hanging out sessions than simple, platonic friendship? Many eyewitnesses and insiders claim there was more… Here are fifteen signs that Cameron Diaz and P. Diddy’s relationship was more than a simple friendship.</p><h2 id=she-chose-him-over-jude-law><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>She Chose Him Over Jude Law</span></h2><p>Cameron was supposed to be hooking up with British screen star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude Law</a> -- or at least, that's what Gwyneth Paltrow was hoping for. The actress had desperately been trying to play matchmaker between the two following Cameron's breakup with Alex. Sadly for Gwyn, it seems like her attempts at playing Cupid weren't successful, as Cameron started seeing P. Diddy instead at around the same time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 20 Stunning Photos Of The Women P.Diddy Has Dated</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-regrets-their-past-relationship><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Regrets Their Past Relationship</span></h2><p>Although they denied it for the longest time, P. Diddy has recently finally come clean and admitted that he and the hot half-Cuban actress were a "thing". He allegedly said at a dinner with friends that he regretted he and Cameron's past relationship and that "if he could turn back time, things would be different".</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: </span><a href=#>Puff Daddy To Sean “Diddy” Combs: 15 Photos Of His Evolution</a></p><h2 id=things-between-them-were-quot-hot-and-steamy-quot><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Things Between Them Were "Hot And Steamy"</span></h2><p>Inside sources have claimed that things between the two celebrities were "hot and steamy" during their time together. Both Cameron and P. Diddy were described as "acting romantic" and apparently "couldn't get their hands off each other" whenever they were together. Seems like they weren't such platonic friends after all.</p><h2 id=they-dated-for-4-years><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>They Dated For 4 Years</span></h2><p>The two of them met in 2008 and have been an on and off thing for four years, before finally breaking it off in 2012. Inside sources claimed that Cameron saw P. Diddy as more of a "booty call" and would hit him up between flings. It would seem like P. Diddy regrets his time with her more than the other way around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-weren-39-t-exclusive><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Weren't Exclusive</span></h2><p>Not only did P. Diddy have his girlfriend Cassie at the time, but he was also known to get frisky with other girls. He was quoted by an insider as "being single" whenever there's "a better offer on the table". Sadly, this wouldn't be the only time P. Diddy's cheated, as ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez broke up with him in the past for that exact reason.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Celebs Who Are Part Of Cameron Diaz's Circle (8 She Can't Stand)</a></span></p><h2 id=they-first-met-at-the-oscars-in-2008><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They First Met At The Oscars In 2008</span></h2><p>As soon as P. Diddy set eyes on Cameron at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscars</a>, he began pursuing her, and who can blame him? As it turns out, the beautiful actress wasn't blind to his charm. The two spent most of the evening together, laughing and flirting. Their fling apparently started shortly after, and the rest is history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-different-attitudes-towards-family><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Have Different Attitudes Towards Family</span></h2><p>Cameron has stated multiple times that she refused to have children. The star loves her independence and that's that, though she's admitted to having a "protective nature". P. Diddy, on the other hand, is very much a family man -- good thing, too, considering the fact that he has seven kids. Could their different attitudes towards family be the cause of their breakup? The world may never know.</p><h2 id=he-considers-her-to-be-the-quot-sexiest-girl-in-the-world-quot><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Considers Her To Be The "Sexiest Girl In The World"</span></h2><p>P. Diddy has been quoted as calling Cameron the "sexiest girl in the world" at a dinner party, after it was revealed that the star had begun dating Good Charlotte's Benji Madden. Apparently, he was bitter that things between him and Cameron hadn't worked out and couldn't stop talking about her. Ouch.</p><h2 id=they-39-ve-been-caught-making-out-multiple-times-in-public><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They've Been Caught Making Out Multiple Times In Public</span></h2><p>Multiple eyewitnesses have described the pair as making out in front of everyone, with some even describing Cameron's hair as being "all over the place". Apparently, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">makeup was even smeared</a>. Seems like their liaison was as passionate as all the inside sources claimed. With how intense things seemed between the two of them, it's a wonder they broke it off to begin with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-denied-that-they-were-a-thing-back-in-the-day><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Denied That They Were A Thing Back In The Day</span></h2><p>Both Cameron and P. Diddy's reps have denied that their relationship was anything other than platonic. P. Diddy had also denied it back in the day, claiming that a "man and a woman could perfectly be just friends". If that were ever true, it would seem like the two celebrities had a pretty big change of heart.</p><h2 id=it-helped-her-get-over-her-romance-with-alex><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Helped Her Get Over Her Romance With Alex</span></h2><p>Cameron Diaz and Alex Rodriguez dated from 2010 to 2011, but the pair broke up to focus on their careers. P. Diddy was reportedly the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first person Cameron hooked up with</a> shortly after the breakup. Considering how long their on and off fling lasted, it seems like he did a pretty good job cheering her up.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-someone-she-can-have-fun-with><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He's Someone She Can Have Fun With</span></h2><p>According to an inside source, both Cameron Diaz and P. Diddy were seen dining at the Osteria Mozza restaurant back in March 2008, where they were seen "giggling and flirting" with each other. They were also were spotted strolling through Washington Square Park on October 25th and according to onlookers, seemed "very comfortable together".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-quot-acted-like-teenagers-quot-together><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They "Acted Like Teenagers" Together</span></h2><p>Other than the public make-out sessions, Cameron was even caught straddling P. Diddy at a post-Golden Globes bash. The sparks between them were so strong that they couldn't even help themselves in public, it would seem. Why they bothered denying that they were more than friends is a mystery.</p><h2 id=he-was-with-cassie-back-when-they-were-hooking-up><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Was With Cassie Back When They Were Hooking Up</span></h2><p>Despite hooking up with Cameron multiple times between 2008 and 2012, P. Diddy reportedly dated Cassie Ventura from 2006 to 2018. The pair would often break up during that time only to get back together again, however, things permanently ended between them in 2018. Although they seemingly ended on good terms, it's very likely that P. Diddy's womanizing ways had something to do with their fallout.</p><h2 id=their-liaison-is-rumored-to-have-annoyed-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Their Liaison Is Rumored To Have Annoyed Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><p>Cameron hooking up with Diddy apparently bothered the famous singer and actress. A source said that when the two started seeing each other, it "cut Jen's heart like a knife". It seems like she wasn't over him, after all. Despite this, both Jennifer Lopez and P. Diddy have remained friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-exes-dated-each-other><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Their Exes Dated Each Other</span></h2><p>As of February 2017, Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez have been dating. They even announced their engagement in March 2019. As it turns out, J-Lo used to date P. Diddy, while Alex dated Cameron Diaz in the past. Talk about an odd coincidence. While Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez worked out, however, both P. Diddy and Cameron went their separate ways and dated other people.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Richest Disney Channel Stars Today, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: Foxnews, Independent, Glamour, The Daily Beast, Yahoo Lifestyle, US Magazine, SheKnows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinZpyZmbG6ecCnm2abkaKys7vNZpuimaqoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyfmJyso2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fernando-torres-net.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fernando Torres Net Worth  Income &amp;amp; Cars">&larr;
