Red (Taylor's Version) will be the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">next rerecorded album</a> for Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She made the announcement on her socials on June 18 after Swifties got #<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1989(Taylor'sVerison) trending</a>. Red (Taylor's Version) will be released on November 19, which is so appropriate because that album screams Fall.</p><p>Two months ago on April 19, Swift released her first rerecorded album, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fearless (Taylor's Version),</a> which featured new vault tracks, collaborations, and the beginning of her owning her back catalog. Now, she is taking the narrative back once again and releasing Red.</p><p>This announcement comes one day before her debut single, "Tim McGraw," turns 15 on June 19. So, put on your country boots once more, because we are gearing up to hear another country-pop album from Taylor Swift.</p><p>Here's what we know about Red (Taylor's Version).</p><h2 id=it-will-have-30-songs><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Will Have 30 Songs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thirty songs is a lot for an album, but when Red first came out, Taylor Swift said in an interview that she had about 30 to 40 songs written and was devastated that she could only put 16 on the album. So, if you look at her announcement and think logically, we can decipher what will be on the album.</p><p>The 16 album tracks, plus three deluxe songs are a guarantee. On her deluxe version Swift also had "State of Grace (Acoustic)" and two recording demos. That adds up to 22 songs. Fans can deduce that the 10-minute version of "All Too Well" will be on there just from her second to last sentence. Then "Babe (featuring Sugarland)" and "Better Man" will most likely be on the album so that equals 25 songs, which leaves 5 vault tracks that have never been heard before.</p><h2 id=here-s-why-november-19-and-june-18-are-significant><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Here's Why November 19 and June 18 Are Significant</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>November 19 is 22 weeks from June 18, which is when she announced the album. "22" is one of Swift's singles off the original Red album. Taylor Swift doesn't do this stuff by accident. Plus, November is Autumn, which is the aesthetic for the album. And not only will she re-release her most heartbreaking album on that day, but it is also International Men's Day, which is a dig to the men who broke her heart. Also, June 18 is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooter Braun's birthday</a>; he's the man who stole her masters from her, so it was the perfect day to announce the new album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Fans Are Saying About Taylor Swift's Next Rerecorded Album</a></span></p><h2 id=here-s-the-hints-we-missed><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Here's The Hints We Missed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The album cover that Swift posted is the same picture that she posted during her "evermore" photo shoot, where she was wearing a red dress, lipstick, and even a ring that says "RED" on it. The photo above is reflective of a photo she had in her original Red album. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a tweet about "evermore"</a> reaching number one, she posted four red hearts at the end- red and it's her fourth album. The evermore vinyl was even red.</p><p>And even another, simple tweet could have been a hint. After winning the Best Family Feature for "The Best Day (Taylor's Version)" at the CMT awards, she quoted the tweet with FOUR words- "I love you mom." She gave fans so many red herrings, and they still thought 1989 was coming.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift And 9 Other Musicians Who Have Written Music Under A Pseudonym</a></span></p><h2 id=it-might-have-a-new-sound><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>It&nbsp;Might Have A New Sound</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift went from country artist to pop star to indie-folk singer, all in a matter of nine albums. Now, in her post about Red (Taylor's Version), she stated that she went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. Does that mean Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol won't be on the new version? Or does she mean collaborators like producers?</p><p>She just started recently working with Aaron Dessner, who produced the last three albums of hers. The other vault songs are bound to feature more collaborators, as well as Sugarland if she puts "Babe" on it. Fearless (Taylor's Version), while nostalgic and almost reflective of her original album, did sound a bit different, especially the Platinum edition songs, so who knows what the deluxe songs and vault songs will sound like? We will find out on November 19.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rerecording-the-album-helped-her-heal><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Rerecording The Album Helped Her Heal</span></h2><p>Red was one of her most heartbreaking albums- for herself and for fans. Now, with the new version, Swift revealed that "I'm not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices singing the lyrics back to me in in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way."</p><p>During the opening night of her Reputation Stadium Tour, right before singing her track 5, heartbreaking ballad, "All Too Well," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she made a speech about how the fans changed that song for her</a>. So, whether it was healing from a break-up, life, her old record label, or whatever else, we're glad she found peace.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Of Taylor Swift's Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-new-version-is-explicit><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The New Version Is Explicit</span></h2><p>Like Taylor Swift's most recent sister albums, folklore and evermore, she is not holding back this time. The new album is available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-order on her website</a>, and there is a clean and explicit version. Back in 2020, Swift not only revealed that "All Too Well" had a ten minute version, but also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">featured the F-bomb</a>, so that's one explicit song. Who knows how many more explicit words will be in the unreleased versions?
