After all, not only was Martin Sheen a huge star, his sons <a href=#>Charlie and Emilio Estevez became filthy rich</a> during their years headlining movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once most actors attain fame and fortune, they go out of their way to make sure they aren’t making the kind of waves that can torpedo their careers. On the other end of the spectrum, it has always seemed like Charlie Sheen’s conduct in his real-life has been more outrageous than any of the characters he’s played.</p><p>When it comes to the vast majority of <a href=#>the most outrageous stories about Charlie Sheen</a>, they are no laughing matter. On the other end of the spectrum, the thing that Sheen did with a leg of lamb, a big hook, and a bottle of whisky one night, however, is entirely hilarious.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Charlie Sheen Regrets His Famous ‘Winning' Hashtag As He Looks Back At His Troubled Past</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-crazy-night>One Crazy Night</h2><p>Since Charlie Sheen has enjoyed so much success throughout his life, he has been able to spend a huge portion of his life doing whatever he wants no matter the cost. In fact, he has done so many wild things throughout his life that <a href=#>everyone forgets about some of the weird deeds Sheen has done</a>. For example, if most stars traveled to Scotland to do what Sheen and his pals did in 2013, their fans would never forget the headlines that would result.</p><p>According to a Scottish hotel owner named Willie Cameron, one day he was minding his own business when he got a call from an American. To Cameron’s surprise, the person on the line asked him to gather “an old-style wooden rowing boat, a traditional Tilley lamp, a boat hook, a thick chain…and a leg of lamb”. When Cameron got that unique shopping list, some wild things likely went through his mind. As it would turn out, the reason for the call likely is stranger than anything that Cameron could imagine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Willie Cameron, he only learned that Charlie Sheen was the one who wanted those items the day before the famous actor arrived. On top of that, Cameron says he was sworn to secrecy, which obviously is a vow Willie eventually broke. Once Sheen arrived, Cameron spent three hours discussing Loch Ness with Charlie and then took him out on the water. Later, Sheen and his friends went out on a boat alone and Cameron came to believe “it was always <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie’s ambition to go on Loch Ness and hunt for the monster</a>”. Unfortunately, Sheen wasn’t able to use the lamb and hook to capture Nessie although it seems all but certain that the whisky worked for its intended purpose.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>17 Celebs Whose Lives Are Even Crazier Than The Rumors You Heard</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-rsquo-s-take>Charlie’s Take</h2><p>Of all the side effects that come along with fame, one of the worst has to be that stars have to deal with lies and rumors that relate to them. For example, there is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an infamous story about Richard Gere and a gerbil</a> that some people believe even though there obviously is no truth to the tale that people have talked about for decades.</p><p>Given the fact that fake stories about stars pop up all the time, it would make sense if most people didn’t believe Willie Cameron’s tale about Charlie Sheen and the Loch Ness Monster. After all, according to Cameron’s own version of events, he may be an unreliable narrator since he blabbed after being sworn to secrecy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rumors Charlie Sheen Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, however, there was no reason for Willie Cameron to keep Charlie Sheen’s secret. After all, in 2013, Sheen tweeted about his Loch Ness monster hunt before he even went out on the boat. On top of that, when Sheen was interviewed by Jay Leno during the mid-2010s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sheen spoke about his search for the Loch Ness Monster</a>. In fact, Sheen revealed that before that fateful night, he’d made one other attempt to hunt for Nessie. “We wanted to spend one night on Loch Ness with a bottle of whisky and a flashlight. But the weather was so bad that we couldn’t do it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After mentioning his first failed attempt at going out on Loch Ness in a boat, Charlie Sheen began to talk about what happened on the water in vague terms. “Something happened – there was an event at the top of the water that was crazy.” Before Sheen could have been pushed for details, Charlie transitioned into asking Jay Leno to accompany him on his next trip to Loch Ness. Even though Sheen has never been specific about his Scottish trip, he has stated that he went on another trip to find a mythical creature called Kushtaka. Far less famous than Nessie, Sheen described Kushtaka as “a shape-shifting half-man, half-otter” before stating he failed to find the creature when he traveled to Alaska to search for it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Moment Things Started Going Downhill For Charlie Sheen</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmiobamedKhnJ6mXZm2pXnSqKSerJieu6h50aKbopuloby2v4ywoK2gXZZ6rbHGZqafZZyWuqN5wGaZop9dnbywt4yapZ1lkWKvsMDTpZxmp5ZixKm10qSwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christian-nodal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christian Nodal">&larr;
