He was also the one who first confirmed that his dad was aboard the vessel when it went missing on June 18. “Hamish my stepdad is lost in submarine thoughts and prayers that the rescue mission will be successful,” he wrote in an FB post.</span></p><p><span>A few days later, Brian then took to his IG to a series of emotional videos on his story, just hours before the vessel’s breathing air supply was expected to run out.&nbsp; “This whole situation is a f**cking nightmare though, everything about it, especially what Hamish is going through down there, it’s just f**cking God awful,” he said before adding that the situation has left him unable to sleep.</span></p><p><span>“I really appreciate the love and support,” he continued. “I haven’t slept in days, it’s not about me, obviously just too worried about my mom and the situation.”</span></p><p><span>But sadly, the world wasn’t buying his “concern.” Even Cardi B, who realized that Brian was at a Blink-182 concert just the day after the sub disappeared, slammed Brian on his IG story. “One of the billionaires, their stepson is at a Blink-182 concert, and people is like, ‘Well what is he supposed to do, be sad at the house? Is he supposed to go look for himself?’ Yes,” the musician said to the camera.</span></p><p><span>She added, “’You are supposed to be at the house sad, be crying for me, you are supposed to be right next to the phone, waiting to hear any updates about me. ‘Isn’t that sad that you are a whole f****g billionaire, and nobody gives a f**k about you?’&nbsp; Like you missing, and mother f****rs are ready to shake d***s at concerts. That’s crazy! I’d rather be broke, and poor then like knowing I’m loved.”</span></p><p><span>In his defense, Brian then made another IG story and said, “I go to a Blink-182 concert, it wasn’t like I was having super fun.” He even went on to label Cardi B a “complete bi*ch” before deleting his entire Twitter account.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, Cardi later fired back at him claiming he was “looking for clout” and branded him “desensitized.”</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Brian Szasz Mother?</b></h3><p><span>Brian Szasz is the son of <a href=#>Linda Harding</a>. She had Brian and his sister Lauren from her previous relationship — before marrying Hamish Harding.</span></p><p><span>With Hamish, Brian’s mother shares two mother sons (Brian’s half-brothers) named Rory and Giles.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his siblings, Brian’s sister Lauren was born in December 1984. She attended</span><i><span> Loyola Marymount University, College of Business Administration</span></i><span> for her Bachelor’s degree in Business/Marketing from 2003 to 2007. Right after graduation, she joined </span><i><span>InsightExpress</span></i><span> as an account manager and she was employed there as of 2023.</span></p><p><span>The last we checked, Lauren was married to Nick, and together, they shared a baby girl named Isla.</span></p><p><span>As for his half-brother, Giles had his own Instagram account (@</span><a href=#><span>giles.explores</span></a><span>) that described him as a teen explorer. On his IG, you can see a lot of posts of the father-son duo setting out on expeditions.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>It was Brian’s mother who asked him to his original “tone-deaf” Facebook post about attending Blink-182’s concert</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Brian Szasz Father?</b></h3><p><span>Brian Szasz’s biological father is named Leslie Szasz.</span></p><p><span>Leslie was born in March 1954 in South Bend, Indiana. He attended </span><i><span>John Adams High School, Indiana University South Bend</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Ohio State University</span></i><span>. Now, he’s employed as a Licensed Independent Social Worker at </span><i><span>Still Meadow Counseling LLC</span></i><span> in Columbus, OH.</span></p><p><span>Find him on Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>leslie.szasz</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Brian Szasz Age</b></h3><p><span>Hamish Harding’s son, Brian Szasz was 32 years of age in 2023.</span></p><h3><b>Brian Szasz Job</b></h3><p><span>Brian Szasz worked as a Recording/Mixing Engineer.</span></p><p><span>As for his education, Brian attended </span><i><span>San Diego State University, Carlsbad High,</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dublin Coffman High School</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Did Brian Szasz Go To Prison?</b></h3><p><span>It’s unclear if Brian Szasz even went to prison. But in March 2007, he and two other armed robbers were indeed arrested on suspicion of a string of armed robberies.</span></p><p><span>“According to the store’s clerk, two men parked a dark green Ford Explorer at the pumps and bought gas,” reported the Union-Tribune. “One man went into the station’s restroom and came out with a bandana over his face, brandishing a large knife at the clerk ‘in a threatening manner.’ The man demanded cash while apologizing to the clerk, ‘claiming he was sorry, but he was out of cash.’”</span></p><p><span>The trio then hit a 7-Eleven 35 minutes later, where they stole 14 cartons of cigarettes and a few hundred dollars.</span></p><p><span>Besides this, Brian also had trouble with the law in 2021 as he was charged with “online stalking” after he “allegedly posted threatening tweets to women in the rave community,”</span></p><h3><b>Is Brian Szasz Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>Brian Szasz was single. Or at least that was what his FB relationship mentioned in 2023.</span></p><p><span>Another reason why we believe he’s single is because of his recent flirty response to a Twitter post made by a scantily-clad OnlyFans model named Brea, which was captioned “Can I sit on u.” Our boy commented, “Yes please!” adding a face with love heart emojis.</span></p><p><span>After this comment made waves on the internet, Brea, who woke up to thousands of replies and likes her post, responded, “Omg, I’m literally just waking up, what is going on,” on Twitter.</span></p><p><span>The model also wrote, “like no way”&nbsp; sharing a post by </span><i><span>Pop Crave</span></i><span> illustrating how Brian Szasz “shoots his shot with OnlyFans model.”</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Brian Szasz Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brian celebrates his birthday on May 29 and is of the Gemini zodiac.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Brian Szasz On Instagram And Twitter?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>audioguy182</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>brian.szasz</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, he deleted his Twitter after he argued with Cardi B (which was a wise decision on his end).</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Brian Szasz Reside?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Brian hails from Oceanside, California. But in 2023, he resided in San Diego, California.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmm6qZlrtuv9maqrNlkp68bq3GnmSjp5JiurDAx56pZqCRora0tIyhmKucmaO0tHnSqKVo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./club-219-milwaukee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bar in Netflix Dahmer Series Was Real">&larr;
