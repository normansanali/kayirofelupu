She was only a kid when Lee realized she could sing, and her parents were also supportive of her talents. The actress cannot remember a specific moment where she looked at herself, and though she wanted to be a singer, Lee said it just came to her, singing along with the TV and music records.</p><p>Lee Rodriguez was born on 28 November 1999 to her parents in California. She recently celebrated her 20th birthday and gave a glimpse of her celebration on her Instagram page. A graduated of the Encore High School, located in California after she was done with her training and education, the actress signed with her manager and agent and started on her pursuit to be a successful singer and also star in movies and TV shows.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BVNbRW7hnQ3/</p><p>The resident of California is a newbie to the world of acting, we could only find two credits to her name on IMDb, and both were in 2018. But slowly, the actress and her team are making sure she is getting the exposure required to further her career. Playing a character in the upcoming highly-anticipated series on Netflix is definitely going to bring some eyeballs to her and her still budding career.</p><h2>Lee Rodriguez Plays Fabiola in the Netflix Series Never Have I Ever</h2><p></p><p>Never Have I Ever is the newest addition to the immense original library of digital content of the streaming giant Netflix. A semi-autobiographical work by talented actress/writer <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> deals with the struggle of a TikTok generation South-Asian teen who finds it hard to adjust with her western friends and the cultural side of her family and relatives.</p><p>Lee Rodriguez plays <strong>Fabiola</strong> in the new series; she is one of the two friends of lead character <strong>Devi</strong>, played by <a href=#><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong></a>. Fabiola and Devi and <strong>Eleanor</strong>, played by <strong>Ramona Young</strong>, hang together and are destined to not be the nerds of the school when it is all said and done. They are also Devi’s confidant when it comes to her sexual desires and everything in between.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/04/Lee-Rodriguez-plays-Fabiola-one-of-Devis-friends-in-the-Netflix-series-Never-Have-I-Ever..jpg alt="Lee Rodriguez plays Fabiola, one of Devi's friends, in the Netflix series Never Have I Ever." width=450 height=253 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lee Rodriguez plays Fabiola, one of Devi's friends, in the Netflix series Never Have I Ever.</strong><br><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Lee Rodriguez Instagram</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Never Have I Ever is one of the highly anticipated series of this year, coming from an acclaimed writer who is known for pushing Indian-subcontinent characters on screen and providing a platform of representation for characters which are extremely stereotyped in Hollywood. The casting process for the show was also extensive; Devi’s role was cast from a pool of 15,000 aspirant South-Asian actresses.</p><p>The new <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series, <a href=#><strong>Never Have I Ever</strong></a>, will be released on 27 April 2020, starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Devi, <strong>Poorna Jagannathan</strong> as <strong>Nalini</strong>, <strong>Sendhil Ramamurthy</strong> as <strong>Mohan</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Richa Moorjani</strong></a> as <strong>Kamala</strong>, Ramona Young as Eleanor, Lee Rodriguez as Fabiola, <strong>Darren Barnet</strong> as <strong>Paxton Hall-Yoshida</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Jaren Lewison</strong></a> as <strong>Ben Gross</strong>.</p><h2>In 10 Years Lee Rodriguez wants to Release an Album and Go on Tour</h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj1DZpwD4nv/</p><p>Before her acting career took off from the ground, Lee Rodriguez saw herself as a successful touring artist. In a <a href=# rel=noopener>2018 interview</a>, the actress said she wants to go on tour in and also drop an album in the next ten years. She definitely has some singing prowess, the actress sang during her graduation ceremony, and she frequently posts singing videos on her Instagram page.</p><p>She also started learning to play guitar in 2018 after her manager and agent got her the instrument for her birthday. Lee is pretty good on the guitar now, but when it comes to her voice, it is her strong suit. When asked about nerves while performing, she said there are little nerves onstage, she gets afraid before going on, but performing takes all the fear away.</p><p>The Fabiola actress recounted a time when she was around six or seven years old when she performed for a small crowd, standing at the top of a staircase. She wanted to perform inside a bar, but to get inside, she needed to be at least 21; instead, the manager allowed her to sing near the entrance of the hotel.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><h2>Social Media Presence of Lee Rodriguez – Also, Is the Actress in a Relationship?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/04/Lee-Rodriguez-is-currently-single-and-focused-on-her-acting-and-singing-career..jpg alt="Lee Rodriguez is currently single and focused on her acting and singing career." width=450 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Lee Rodriguez is currently single and focused on her acting and singing career.</strong><br><strong>Source: Lee Rodriguez Instagram</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Lee Rodriguez joined Instagram in 2015, but looking at her post count does not give that away. The first post from the actress was a video of her playing a keyboard, and over the years, she has updated her followers about her life. The actress only recently became a frequent user of the image sharing site where she is currently promoting her new show. She has over 3,000 followers on her Instagram page, which is only going to rise after the release of Never Have I Ever.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>As mentioned above, the actress is pretty frugal about posting pictures on her social media page. When it comes to posting about her relationship on or any personal detail, the actress is even more tightlipped. A beautiful lady by the name of <strong>Tira</strong> frequented her Instagram page in the 2018s, but what to what extent their relationship went is a mystery. It seems the actress is currently single and ready to further both her singing and acting career simultaneously.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Before you leave, make sure to visit <a href=#><strong>Celebs In-depth</strong></a> for more <a href=#><strong>Biography</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Celeb Life</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGijnp1dp7ylvsigrJ6yXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./miley-cyrus-dated-hannah-montana-co-star-lucas-till-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus Dated Her 'Hannah Montana' Co-Star Lucas Till">&larr;
