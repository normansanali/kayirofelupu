Well, Teimojin Tan dared to do it! On History Channel’s </span><i><span>Alone</span></i><span> season 9, Teimojin used his skill as a doctor and a former army soldier to endure total isolation, punishing weather, and deadly predators.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this “Teimojin Tan Bio” to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan On History TV’s Alone</b></h3><p><span>History Channel’s </span><i><span>Alone</span></i><span> returned for its 9th installment on May 26, 2022, and as always it saw a bunch of contestants including Teimojin dropped off in “an undisclosed, remote location” — which was later revealed to be Labrador, Canada.</span></p><p><span>So, given Labrador’s fame for being “the hunting ground for the polar bear,” it obvious that some were bound to come into contact with the predator. This meant more risk! Furthermore, the isolation and undesirable weather certainly weren’t helping the contestants at all.</span></p><p><span>Some sites even labeled this season to have the “toughest conditions to date.”</span></p><p><span>But on the contrary, our star, Teimojin Tan seemed to have enjoyed this journey. Well-equipped with his professional skills and 10 other items, Teimojin shared that he had a “life-changing experience” in the wild. “This might be the start of a drastic career change. I’ve been away from home for several years and I am a different person. This experience I’m about to share with you will show you who I am today and who I hope to be,” Teimojin posted before the premiere.</span></p><p><span>As for the 10 items he chose, they were — Sleeping bag, Ax, Multitool, Ferro rod, 2-quart pot, Bow and arrows, Paracord, Trapping wire, Fishing line and hooks, and Emergency rations.</span></p><p><span>Joining Teimojin this season were his co-stars — dam Riley, Jacques Turcotte, Jessie Krebs, Juan Pablo Quinonez, Karin Lee, Terry Burns, Tom Garstang, Benji Hill, and Igor Limansky.</span></p><p><span>All excited to see himself on the show, Teimojin took it to his IG on April 22, to share, “ am incredibly excited to share this with you… Last summer I set off with these amazing people to endure a challenge like no other.”</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan Job</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin Tan is a soldier-turned-doctor who worked at </span><i><span>Grey Bruce Health Services</span></i><span> as of 2022. This was his first job as a medical doctor after completing his residency at </span><i><span>Beaumont Health</span></i><span> from June 2018 to November 2021.</span></p><p><span>So, how did a military-personnel turn into a life of a doctor? Well, Teimojin always had a passion for traveling, and as he did, he developed a fascination and appreciation for indigenous cultures. But that wasn’t all. During his trips, Teimojin also met different people in need and realized he was helpless to render aid.</span></p><p><span>Thus, to be financially independent, Teimojin joined the Canadian Army Reserve as an Infantry soldier in June 2007. There he took a special interest in Cold Weather Warfare & Survival and spent months in the Subarctic learning how to make improvised defenses, conducting patrols and assaults, and being involved in search and rescue missions.</span></p><p><span>Finally, in August 2014, Teimojin retired from the military as a corporal and went back to his main goal, “to help people,” and joined the </span><i><span>Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine</span></i><span> and graduated with a Doctor of Medicine 4 years later.</span></p><p><span>Now, besides representing a group of medical professionals and survival experts who operate in the most austere environments, he also offered educational material about survival and medical management in challenging scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some of the merch Teimojin sold on his website included items like North American Rescue (NAR) Individual Bleeding Control Kit in a Vacuum Sealed Pouch, NAR Packing Gauze, NAR Hyfin Chest Seals, and QuikClot Hemostatic Gauze.</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin Tan flaunted a net worth of above $1 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>As a general practitioner in Canada, he made around $250 thousand per annum. And during his stint on </span><i><span>Alone</span></i><span>, he received around $1 – $2 thousand per week.</span></p><h3><b>Is Teimojin Tan On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, find Teimojin on Instgram @</span><a href=#><span>survival.doctors</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s his Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>survivaldoctor</span></a><span> (private) and @</span><a href=#><span>survivalmedicine</span></a><span> (group), Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>survivaldoctors</span></a><span>, TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>survival.doctors</span></a><span>, and Youtube @</span><a href=#><span>survivaldoctors</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan Age</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin Tan was 31 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Alone</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>You can pronounce his name as “TIM-oh-gin TAN.”</span></p><p><span>But Teimojin’s full name is “Caporol Teimojin Nicholas Wei-Cheng Tan.</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan Family</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin Tan comes from a family of four — his parents, himself, and his sister.</span></p><p><span>Though Teimojin didn’t talk much about his dad, he didn’t hold back from showing his love for his mother over his socials. On Mother’s day 2020, he even dedicated a TikTok video to her.</span></p><p><span>As for his sister, Isabelle Lee is a teacher. She taught kindergarten and elementary education at </span><i><span>Commission Scolaire Riverside</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> One of the reasons, Teimojin appeared on </span><i><span>Alone</span></i><span> was to inspire his family in Montreal and anyone else “who feels like they’re stuck in their lives either because they’re too comfortable or too afraid to fail.”</span></p><h3><b>Does Teimojin Tan Have A Wife?</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin Tan didn’t reveal any information about his wife.</span></p><p><span>However, we did stumble upon a few pics of Teimojin getting comfortable with some ladies over his FB. Perhaps, they were his ex-girlfriends?</span></p><h3><b>Teimojin Tan Height</b></h3><p><span>Teimojin stands tall at a height under 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Teimojin Tan From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Teimojin hails from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
